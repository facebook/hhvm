define: DUK_OPT_NO_FILE_IO
introduced: 1.0.0

description: >
  Disable use of ANSI C file I/O which might be a portability issue on some
  platforms.  Causes duk_eval_file() to throw an error, makes built-in
  print() and alert() no-ops, and suppresses writing of a panic
  message to stderr on panic.  This option does not suppress debug
  printing so don't enable debug printing if you wish to avoid I/O.
