% Genrating n symbols.
% =============================================================================
% The actual symbol created in Python interface is internal_symbols/2,
% The first arity is a string, the second arity is a number.
% like, internal_symbols("S0", 0).
% We are converting it to symbols/1. here, simply ignore the second arity with "_".
symbols(X) :- internal_symbols(X, _).
% Uncomment this for an easy prototyping without Python interface.
% symbols(1..n).
% internal_symbols(_, X) :- symbols(X).


% We separated the below part to Python interface to avoid "grounding bottleneck."
% And we are using normal distribution to create a sequence of "extends_to" among
% n nodes. For n = 100, we can use
% extends_to(1, 11).
% extends_to(11, 21).
% extends_to(21, 31).
% extends_to(31, 41).
% extends_to(41, 51).
% extends_to(51, 61).
% extends_to(61, 71).
% extends_to(71, 81).
% extends_to(81, 91).

% Minimum depth requirement.

% path(X, Y, L + 1) :- extends_to(X, Z), path(Z, Y, L), L < depth + 1.

% Average width requirement.
% =============================================================================
% Calculate the in/out degree of each symbol.
in_degree(X, D) :- symbols(X), D = #count{ Y : extends_to(Y, X) }.
out_degree(X, D) :- symbols(X), D = #count{ Y : extends_to(X, Y) }.
% One class or interface at most can have 10 extends relationship.
% We can adjust this one later, base on the profiling from actual software.
% We believed if a code has more than 10 extends/implements is a bad design.
% Therefore, we added this constraint to prevent AI synthesis bad code.
:- in_degree(X, D), D > 10.
% Constraint on a symbol can't be extended by more than 30 other symbols.
:- out_degree(X, D), D > 30.

% Average constraint.
% Instead of computing the sum of all degrees and divided by n, we changed the
% average degree requirement to the degree distribution in our Python interface.


% If class X has no parent class, we consider it as a "stub" class, which could
% be servered as a "cut" node to connect this agent with other agents.
has_parent_class(X) :- extends_to(Y, X), class(Y), class(X).
:- #count{X: class(X), not has_parent_class(X)} < number_of_stub_classes.

% If interface X has no parent interfaces, we consider it as a "stub" interface
% which could be servered as a "cut" node to connect this agent with others.
:- #count{X: in_degree(X, 0), interface(X)} < number_of_stub_interfaces.
