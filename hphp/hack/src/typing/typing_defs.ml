   * newtype my_type as int = ...

  (* This is in the case where we are looking for an intersection
   * basically without this type, we could never infer that an array
   * is an array of mixed for example.
   * if I write $x = 0; and then $x = true; well technically, it is
   * correct, there is a type that $x could have, and that's the type
   * mixed. Thanks to the inter type we can now make this happen.
   * On some operations, a type is allowed to "grow". That is,
   * we don't know what the type of that thing is (yet). So we
   * delay the moment where we are going to check on this type.
   * Once it is unified with a "true" type (one that cannot grow),
   * then we "fold" the intersection, that is we verify that every
   * member of the intersection is a subtype of that type. If
   * this is the case, Yay! we have found a common ancestor for the
   * intersection. However, note that once the type has been "folded",
   * it cannot grow anymore ...
