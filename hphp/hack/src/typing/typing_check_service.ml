The type checking service receives a list of files and their symbols as input and
distributes the work to worker processes.

A worker process's input is a subset of files. At the end of its work,
it returns back to master the following progress report:
  - completed: a list of computations it completed
  - remaining: a list of computations which it didn't end up performing. For example,
    it may not have been able to get through the whole list of computations because
    it exceeded its worker memory cap
  - deferred: a list of computations which were discovered to be necessary to be
    performed before some of the computations in the input subset

The deferred list needs further explanation, so read below.

####

Here's how we actually plumb through the workitems and their individual results, via MultiWorker:
* We have mutable state [ref files_to_process], a list of filenames still to be processed
    for the entire typecheck.
* Datatype [progress] represents an input batch of work for a worker to do,
    and also an output indication of how it dispatched that batch
* Datatype [typing_result] represents the accumulation of telemetry, errors, deps results from workers.
    Each individual worker is given an empty [typing_result] as input,
    and merges its own results into that empty input to give a per-worker output,
    and then we have a separate accumulator and we merge each per-worker's output
    into that accumulator.
* next : () -> progress
    This mutates [files_to_process] by removing a bucket of filenames,
    and returns a degenerate progress {remaining=bucket; completed=[]; deferred=[]}
    which is basically just the bucket of work to be done by the job.
* neutral : typing_result
    This value is just the empty typing_result {errors=Empty; deps=Empty; telemetry=Empty}
* job : typing_result -> progress -> (typing_result', progress')
    MultiWorker will invoke this job. For input,
    it provides a copy of the degenerate [typing_result] that it got from [neutral], and
    it provides the degenerate [progress] i.e. just the bucket of work that it got from [next]
    The behavior of our job is to take items out of progress.remaining and typecheck them.
    It repeats this process until it either runs out of items or its heap grows too big.
    It returns a new progress' {remaining'; completed; deferred} to show the items still
    remaining, the ones it completed, and the ones it had to defer (see below).
    It returns a new typing_result' {errors; deps; telemetry} by merging its own
    newly discovered errors, deps, telemetry onto the (degenerate i.e. empty)
    typing_result it was given as input.
* merge :  (typing_result * progress) (accumulator : typing_result) -> typing_result
    The initial value of accumulator is the same [neutral] that was given to each job.
    After each job, MultiWorker calls [merge] to merge the results of that job
    into the accumulator.
    Our merge function looks at the progress {remaining;completed;deferred} that
    came out of the job, and mutates [files_to_process] by sticking back "remaining+deferred" into it.
    It then merges the typing_result {errors;deps;telemetry} that came out of the job
    with those in its accumulator.

The type signatures for MultiWorker look like they'd allow a variety of implementations,
e.g. having just a single accumulator that starts at "neutral" and feeds one by one into
each job. But we don't do that.

####

The normal computation kind for the type checking service is to type check all symbols in a file.
The type checker would always be able to find a given symbol it needs to perform this job
if all the declarations were computed for all the files in the repo before type checking begins.

However, such eager declaration does not occur in the following scenarios:
  - When the server initialization strategy is Lazy: not having a declaration phase was
      the original meaning of lazy init
  - If the server initialized from a saved state: most decls would not be available because
      saved states only consist of one or more of the following: naming table, dependency
      graph, errors, and hot decls (a small subset of all possible decls)

The decl heap module, when asked for a decl that is not yet in memory, can declare the decl's
file lazily. Declaring a file means parsing the file and extracting the symbols declared in it,
hence the term 'decl'.

This lazy declaration strategy works reasonably well for most cases, but there's a case where
it works poorly: if a particular file that is getting type checked requires a large number
of symbols which have not yet been declared, the unlucky worker ends up serially declaring
all the files that contain those symbols. In some cases, we observe type checking times on
the order of minutes for a single file.

Therefore, to account for the fact that we don't have the overall eager declaration phase
in some initialization scenarios, the decl heap module is now capable of refusing to declare
a file and instead adding the file to a list of deferments.

The type checker worker is then able to return that list and the file which was being type
checked when deferments occured back to the master process. The master process is then
able to distribute the declaration of the files and the (re)checking of the original
file to all of its workers, thus achieving parallelism and better type checking times overall.

The deferment of declarations is adjustable: it works by using a threshold value that dictates
the maximum number of lazy declarations allowed per file. If the threshold is not set, then
there is no limit, and no declarations would be deferred. If the threshold is set at 1,
then all declarations would be deferred.

The idea behind deferring declarations is similar to the 2nd of the 4 build systems considered in
the following paper (Make, Excel's calc engine, Shake, and Bazel):
    https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems-final.pdf

The paper refers to this approach as "restarting", and further suggests that recording and reusing
the chain of jobs could be used to minimize the number of restarts.
