## Installation

You may need to point CMake to the location of your custom libcurl and libevent, or to any other libraries which needed to be installed. The *CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH* variable is used to hint to the location.

    export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/user

To build HipHop, use the following:

    cd /home/user/dev
    git clone git://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php.git
    cd hiphop-php
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    export HPHP_HOME=`pwd`
    export HPHP_LIB=`pwd`/bin
    cmake .

Once this is done you can generate the build file. This will return you to the shell. Finally, to build, run `make`. If any errors occur, it may be required to remove the CMakeCache.txt directory in the checkout.

    make
