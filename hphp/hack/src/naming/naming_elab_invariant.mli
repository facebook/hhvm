(* invariant is subject to a source-code transform in the HHVM
 * runtime: the arguments to invariant are lazily evaluated only in
 * the case in which the invariant condition does not hold. So:
 *
 *   invariant_violation(<condition>, <format>, <format_args...>)
 *
 * ... is rewritten as:
 *
 *   if (!<condition>) {
 *     invariant_violation(<format>, <format_args...>);
 *   }
