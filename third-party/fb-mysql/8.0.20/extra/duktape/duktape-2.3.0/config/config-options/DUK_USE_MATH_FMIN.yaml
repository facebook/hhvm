  Assume platform function fmin() is available and works correctly.
  Some platforms don't have fmin() (it is defined in C99) and on some
  platforms (e.g. some uclibc environments) it may not be provided even
  though the compilation environment is nominally C99.

  Removed in Duktape 2.0.0: if the platform doesn't have fmin(), simply
  define a replacement for DUK_FMIN().
