:::info[Note]
This is a point-in-time snapshot of the API documentation from January 2026.
Going forward, we will not be maintaining a public copy of these references,
and recommend users to refer to the built-in signature helpers available in
the Hack LSP instead for complete and up-to-date information.
:::

Create a semaphore




``` Hack
public function __construct(
  int $concurrentLimit,
  (function(Tin): Awaitable<Tout>) $f,
);
```




The concurrent limit is per instance; for example, if there are two ongoing requests
executing the same code, there will be up to concurrentLimit in each request, meaning
up to 2 * concurrentLimit in total.




## Parameters




+ ` int $concurrentLimit `
+ ` (function(Tin): Awaitable<Tout>) $f `
