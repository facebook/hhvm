description: >
  Enable support for "use strict" declaration (recommended).

  When disabled, Ecmascript code is always executed in non-strict mode.
  Duktape/C functions remain strict.  This option is useful in some legacy
  environments where "use strict" declarations are used in existing code
  base but the Javascript engine didn't actually support strict mode.
