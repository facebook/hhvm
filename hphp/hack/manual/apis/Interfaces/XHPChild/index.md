:::info[Note]
This is a point-in-time snapshot of the API documentation from January 2026.
Going forward, we will not be maintaining a public copy of these references,
and recommend users to refer to the built-in signature helpers available in
the Hack LSP instead for complete and up-to-date information.
:::

XHPChild is the base type of values that can be children of XHP elements




Most primitive types implement XHPChild: string, int, float, and array.




Classes that implement XHPChild must do so by implementing the XHPChildClass
subinterface.




## Interface Synopsis




``` Hack
interface XHPChild {...}
```
