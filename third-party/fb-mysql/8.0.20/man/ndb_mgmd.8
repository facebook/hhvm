.PP
The management server is the process that reads the cluster configuration file and distributes this information to all nodes in the cluster that request it\&. It also maintains a log of cluster activities\&. Management clients can connect to the management server and check the cluster\*(Aqs status\&.
.PP
The following table includes options that are specific to the NDB Cluster management server program
\fBndb_mgmd\fR\&. Additional descriptions follow the table\&. For options common to most NDB Cluster programs (including
\fBndb_mgmd\fR), see
Options Common to NDB Cluster Programs(1)\&.

This option, whose default value is

\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR
.RE
.sp
Using one of the options just listed is effective only if the management server has no stored configuration at the time it is started\&. If the management server finds any configuration cache files, then the
\fB\-\-config\-cache\fR
option or the
\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR
option is ignored\&. Therefore, to disable configuration caching, the option should be used the
\fIfirst\fR
time that the management server is started\&. Otherwise\(emthat is, if you wish to disable configuration caching for a management server that has
\fIalready\fR
created a configuration cache\(emyou must stop the management server, delete any existing configuration cache files manually, then restart the management server with
\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR
(or with
\fB\-\-config\-cache\fR
set equal to 0,
OFF, or
FALSE)\&.
.sp
Configuration cache files are normally created in a directory named
mysql\-cluster
under the installation directory (unless this location has been overridden using the
\fB\-\-configdir\fR
option)\&. Each time the management server updates its configuration data, it writes a new cache file\&. The files are named sequentially in order of creation using the following format:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
ndb_\fInode\-id\fR_config\&.bin\&.\fIseq\-number\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fInode\-id\fR
is the management server\*(Aqs node ID;
\fIseq\-number\fR
is a sequence number, beginning with 1\&. For example, if the management server\*(Aqs node ID is 5, then the first three configuration cache files would, when they are created, be named
ndb_5_config\&.bin\&.1,
ndb_5_config\&.bin\&.2, and
ndb_5_config\&.bin\&.3\&.
.sp
If your intent is to purge or reload the configuration cache without actually disabling caching, you should start
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
with one of the options
\fB\-\-reload\fR
or
\fB\-\-initial\fR
instead of
\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR\&.
.sp
To re\-enable the configuration cache, simply restart the management server, but without the
\fB\-\-config\-cache\fR
or
\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR
option that was used previously to disable the configuration cache\&.
.sp
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
does not check for the configuration directory (\fB\-\-configdir\fR) or attempts to create one when
\fB\-\-skip\-config\-cache\fR
is used\&. (Bug #13428853)

Configuration data is cached internally, rather than being read from the cluster global configuration file each time the management server is started (see
Section\ \&22.3.3, \(lqNDB Cluster Configuration Files\(rq)\&. Using the
\fB\-\-initial\fR
option overrides this behavior, by forcing the management server to delete any existing cache files, and then to re\-read the configuration data from the cluster configuration file and to build a new cache\&.
.sp
This differs in two ways from the
\fB\-\-reload\fR
option\&. First,
\fB\-\-reload\fR
forces the server to check the configuration file against the cache and reload its data only if the contents of the file are different from the cache\&. Second,
\fB\-\-reload\fR
does not delete any existing cache files\&.
.sp
If
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
is invoked with
\fB\-\-initial\fR
but cannot find a global configuration file, the management server cannot start\&.
.sp
When a management server starts, it checks for another management server in the same NDB Cluster and tries to use the other management server\*(Aqs configuration data\&. This behavior has implications when performing a rolling restart of an NDB Cluster with multiple management nodes\&. See
Section\ \&22.5.5, \(lqPerforming a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster\(rq, for more information\&.
.sp
When used together with the
\fB\-\-config\-file\fR
option, the cache is cleared only if the configuration file is actually found\&.

Causes
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
to be installed as a Windows service\&. Optionally, you can specify a name for the service; if not set, the service name defaults to
ndb_mgmd\&. Although it is preferable to specify other
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
program options in a
my\&.ini
or
my\&.cnf
configuration file, it is possible to use them together with
\fB\-\-install\fR\&. However, in such cases, the
\fB\-\-install\fR
option must be specified first, before any other options are given, for the Windows service installation to succeed\&.
.sp
It is generally not advisable to use this option together with the
\fB\-\-initial\fR
option, since this causes the configuration cache to be wiped and rebuilt every time the service is stopped and started\&. Care should also be taken if you intend to use any other
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
options that affect the starting of the management server, and you should make absolutely certain you fully understand and allow for any possible consequences of doing so\&.

When starting an NDB Cluster is configured with two management nodes, each management server normally checks to see whether the other
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
is also operational and whether the other management server\*(Aqs configuration is identical to its own\&. However, it is sometimes desirable to start the cluster with only one management node (and perhaps to allow the other
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
to be started later)\&. This option causes the management node to bypass any checks for any other management nodes whose node IDs are passed to this option, permitting the cluster to start as though configured to use only the management node that was started\&.
.sp
For purposes of illustration, consider the following portion of a
config\&.ini
file (where we have omitted most of the configuration parameters that are not relevant to this example):

Assume that you wish to start this cluster using only the management server having node ID
10
and running on the host having the IP address 198\&.51\&.100\&.150\&. (Suppose, for example, that the host computer on which you intend to the other management server is temporarily unavailable due to a hardware failure, and you are waiting for it to be repaired\&.) To start the cluster in this way, use a command line on the machine at 198\&.51\&.100\&.150 to enter the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBndb_mgmd \-\-ndb\-nodeid=10 \-\-nowait\-nodes=11\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
As shown in the preceding example, when using
\fB\-\-nowait\-nodes\fR, you must also use the
\fB\-\-ndb\-nodeid\fR
option to specify the node ID of this
\fBndb_mgmd\fR
process\&.
.sp
You can then start each of the cluster\*(Aqs data nodes in the usual way\&. If you wish to start and use the second management server in addition to the first management server at a later time without restarting the data nodes, you must start each data node with a connection string that references both management servers, like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBndbd \-c 198\&.51\&.100\&.150,198\&.51\&.100\&.151\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The same is true with regard to the connection string used with any
\fBmysqld\fR
processes that you wish to start as NDB Cluster SQL nodes connected to this cluster\&. See
Section\ \&22.3.3.3, \(lqNDB Cluster Connection Strings\(rq, for more information\&.
.sp
When used with
\fBndb_mgmd\fR, this option affects the behavior of the management node with regard to other management nodes only\&. Do not confuse it with the
\fB\-\-nowait\-nodes\fR
option used with
\fBndbd\fR
or
\fBndbmtd\fR
to permit a cluster to start with fewer than its full complement of data nodes; when used with data nodes, this option affects their behavior only with regard to other data nodes\&.
.sp
Multiple management node IDs may be passed to this option as a comma\-separated list\&. Each node ID must be no less than 1 and no greater than 255\&. In practice, it is quite rare to use more than two management servers for the same NDB Cluster (or to have any need for doing so); in most cases you need to pass to this option only the single node ID for the one management server that you do not wish to use when starting the cluster\&.

When you later start the

NDB Cluster configuration data is stored internally rather than being read from the cluster global configuration file each time the management server is started (see
Section\ \&22.3.3, \(lqNDB Cluster Configuration Files\(rq)\&. Using this option forces the management server to check its internal data store against the cluster configuration file and to reload the configuration if it finds that the configuration file does not match the cache\&. Existing configuration cache files are preserved, but not used\&.
.sp
This differs in two ways from the
\fB\-\-initial\fR
option\&. First,
\fB\-\-initial\fR
causes all cache files to be deleted\&. Second,
\fB\-\-initial\fR
forces the management server to re\-read the global configuration file and construct a new cache\&.
.sp
If the management server cannot find a global configuration file, then the
\fB\-\-reload\fR
option is ignored\&.
.sp
When
\fB\-\-reload\fR
is used, the management server must be able to communicate with data nodes and any other management servers in the cluster before it attempts to read the global configuration file; otherwise, the management server fails to start\&. This can happen due to changes in the networking environment, such as new IP addresses for nodes or an altered firewall configuration\&. In such cases, you must use
\fB\-\-initial\fR
instead to force the exsiting cached configuration to be discarded and reloaded from the file\&. See
Section\ \&22.5.5, \(lqPerforming a Rolling Restart of an NDB Cluster\(rq, for additional information\&.

It is not strictly necessary to specify a connection string when starting the management server\&. However, if you are using more than one management server, a connection string should be provided and each node in the cluster should specify its node ID explicitly\&.
