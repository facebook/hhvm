/**
 * Creates and returns a socket resource, also referred to as an endpoint of
 *   communication. A typical network connection is made up of 2 sockets, one
 *   performing the role of the client, and another performing the role of the
 *   server.
 *
 * @param int $domain - The domain parameter specifies the protocol family to
 *   be used by the socket. Available address/protocol families Domain
 *   Description AF_INET IPv4 Internet based protocols. TCP and UDP are common
 *   protocols of this protocol family. AF_INET6 IPv6 Internet based protocols.
 *   TCP and UDP are common protocols of this protocol family. AF_UNIX Local
 *   communication protocol family. High efficiency and low overhead make it a
 *   great form of IPC (Interprocess Communication).
 * @param int $type - The type parameter selects the type of communication to
 *   be used by the socket. Available socket types Type Description SOCK_STREAM
 *   Provides sequenced, reliable, full-duplex, connection-based byte streams.
 *   An out-of-band data transmission mechanism may be supported. The TCP
 *   protocol is based on this socket type. SOCK_DGRAM Supports datagrams
 *   (connectionless, unreliable messages of a fixed maximum length). The UDP
 *   protocol is based on this socket type. SOCK_SEQPACKET Provides a sequenced,
 *   reliable, two-way connection-based data transmission path for datagrams of
 *   fixed maximum length; a consumer is required to read an entire packet with
 *   each read call. SOCK_RAW Provides raw network protocol access. This special
 *   type of socket can be used to manually construct any type of protocol. A
 *   common use for this socket type is to perform ICMP requests (like ping).
 *   SOCK_RDM Provides a reliable datagram layer that does not guarantee
 *   ordering. This is most likely not implemented on your operating system.
 * @param int $protocol - The protocol parameter sets the specific protocol
 *   within the specified domain to be used when communicating on the returned
 *   socket. The proper value can be retrieved by name by using
 *   getprotobyname(). If the desired protocol is TCP, or UDP the corresponding
 *   constants SOL_TCP, and SOL_UDP can also be used. Common protocols Name
 *   Description icmp The Internet Control Message Protocol is used primarily by
 *   gateways and hosts to report errors in datagram communication. The "ping"
 *   command (present in most modern operating systems) is an example
 *   application of ICMP. udp The User Datagram Protocol is a connectionless,
 *   unreliable, protocol with fixed record lengths. Due to these aspects, UDP
 *   requires a minimum amount of protocol overhead. tcp The Transmission
 *   Control Protocol is a reliable, connection based, stream oriented, full
 *   duplex protocol. TCP guarantees that all data packets will be received in
 *   the order in which they were sent. If any packet is somehow lost during
 *   communication, TCP will automatically retransmit the packet until the
 *   destination host acknowledges that packet. For reliability and performance
 *   reasons, the TCP implementation itself decides the appropriate octet
 *   boundaries of the underlying datagram communication layer. Therefore, TCP
 *   applications must allow for the possibility of partial record transmission.
 *
 * @return mixed - socket_create() returns a socket resource on success, or
 *   FALSE on error. The actual error code can be retrieved by calling
 *   socket_last_error(). This error code may be passed to socket_strerror() to

 *   from the queue. MSG_WAITALL Block until at least len are received. However,
 *   if a signal is caught or the remote host disconnects, the function may
 *   return less data. MSG_DONTWAIT With this flag set, the function returns
 *   even if it would normally have blocked.
 * @param mixed $name - If the socket is of the type AF_UNIX type, name is the
 *   path to the file. Else, for unconnected sockets, name is the IP address of,
 *   the remote host, or NULL if the socket is connection-oriented.
 * @param mixed $port - This argument only applies to AF_INET and AF_INET6
 *   sockets, and specifies the remote port from which the data is received. If
 *   the socket is connection-oriented, port will be NULL.
 *
 * @return mixed - socket_recvfrom() returns the number of bytes received, or
 *   FALSE if there was an error. The actual error code can be retrieved by
 *   calling socket_last_error(). This error code may be passed to
 *   socket_strerror() to get a textual explanation of the error.
