  // guess, we will use the ActRec seen on the top of stack at compilation
  // time as a hint for refs going forward.

  // this tracelet is executed, no matter what else has happened, the ActRec
  // closest to the top of the stack WILL contain m_topFunc. This means: if that
  // function is defined conditionally, or defined in some other module, you
  // cannot correctly make that assertion. KNOWN indicates absolute certainty
  // about all possible futures.
  //
  // This strange "not-guessed-yet-but-could" state is required by our
  // VM design; at present, the ActRec is not easily recoverable from an
  // arbitrary instruction boundary. However, it can be recovered from the
  // instructions that need to do so.
