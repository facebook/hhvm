Fatal error: %s/no-config/test.php appears to be a Hack file, but you do not appear to be running the Hack typechecker. See the documentation at http://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/install.hack.bootstrapping.php for information on getting it running. You can also set Hack.Lang.LookForTypechecker=0 to disable this check (not recommended).
