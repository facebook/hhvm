module Syntax = Full_fidelity_editable_positioned_syntax

(**
 * Transforms a full-fidelity syntax tree to generate the required constructs
 * for coroutines. The resulting full-fidelity syntax tree should contain the
 * required state machines for coroutine functions, coroutine functions
 * themselves should be rewritten into stubs that wrap calls into the coroutine
 * state machines, and so forth.
 *
 * The coroutine architecture used by Hack is inspired by the implementation in
 * Kotlin. You can read more about Kotlin's design and implementation details at
 * https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-coroutines/blob/master/kotlin-coroutines-informal.md.
