  Add this define to both Duktape and application build when Duktape is
  compiled as a DLL.  This is especially critical on Windows: the option
  makes Duktape use __declspec(dllexport) and __declspec(dllimport) for
  public symbols.

  While this is not currently needed for Unix platforms, it should always
  be used if you build as a DLL.
