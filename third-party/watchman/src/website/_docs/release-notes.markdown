Watchman is continuously deployed inside Facebook, which means that we don't
explicitly maintain version numbers.  We have automation that cuts a weekly
tag with a named derived from the date.  You can learn more about how to reason
about supported *capabilities* and our backwards compatibility guidelines
in the [Compatibility Rules](compatibility.html) docs.

We focus on the highlights only in these release notes.  For a full history
that includes all of the gory details, please see [the commit history on
GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/commits/main).

### Watchman v2020.07.13.00

* Added script `watchman-replicate-subscription`. It can replicate an 
  existing watchman subscription. Integrators can use this script to validate
  watchman notifications their client is receiving.
* Added support for suffix sets in suffix expressions.  You now can specify
  multiple suffixes to match against by setting the second argument to a list
  of suffixes. See `suffix-set` documentation for
  [more details](/watchman/docs/expr/suffix.html#suffix-set)
* pywatchman: introduced new pywatchman_aio client for python
* Windows: we no longer trust environment variables to locate the state directory
  which should result in a better experience for users that mix cygwin, mingw,
  native windows and/or WSL or other environments
* Windows: we now support unix domain sockets on Windows 10.  The CLI will prefer
  to use unix domain sockets when available.

We weren't great at updating the release notes since the prior release;
there was a lot of work to support our sister project EdenFS that isn't
broadly relevant to those outside FB at the time of writing.

### Watchman 4.9.0 (2017-08-24)

* New field: `content.sha1hex`.  This field expands to the SHA1 hash of
  the file contents, expressed in hex digits (40 character hex string).
  Watchman maintains a cache of the content hashes and can compute the
  hash on demand and also heuristically as files are changed.  This is
  useful for tooling that wants to perform more intelligent cache invalidation
  or build artifact fetching from content addressed storage.
* Experimental feature: Source Control Aware query mode.  Currently supports
  only Mercurial (patches to add Git support are welcomed!).  SCM aware query
  mode helps to keep response sizes closer to `O(what-you-changed)` than
  to `O(all-repo-changes)` when rebasing your code.  Using this feature
  effectively may require some additional infrastructure to compute and
  associate data with revisions from your repo.
* Fixed an issue that resulted in the perf logging thread deadlocking when
  `perf_logger_command` is enabled in the global configuration
* Fixed an issue where queries larger than 1MB would likely result in
  a PDU error response.
* Reduced lock contention for subscriptions that do no use the advanced
  settling (`drop`, `defer`) options.
* Fixed `since` generator behavior when using unix timestamps rather than
  the preferred clock string syntax
* Improved the reporting of "new" files in watchman results
* Improved performance of handling changes on case insensitive filesystems
* Windows: promoted from alpha to beta status!
* Windows: fixed some performance and reliability issues
* Windows: now operates correctly on Windows 7
* Windows: can now see and report symlinks and junction points
* Windows: fixed potential deadlock in trigger deletion
* Windows: fixed stack trace rendering on win32
* Windows: improved IO scheduling around deletes on win32
* Windows: improved handling of case insensitive win32 driver letters
* pywatchman: the python wheel format is used for publishing watchman pypi package
* pywatchman: now watchman path is configurable in python client
* pywatchman: now python client can be used as a context manager
* Solaris: support for Solaris has been removed. If you'd like to commit to
  testing and maintaining Solaris support, we'd love to hear from you!

### Watchman 4.8.0 (never formally released)

Whoops, we never got around to tagging this beyond a release candidate tag!

* New command `flush-subscriptions` to synchronize subscriptions associated
  with the current session.
* On Windows, return `/` as the directory separator.  Previously we used `\`.
  This change should be pretty neutral for clients, and makes it easier to work
  with both the internals and the integration test infrastructure.
* Enforce socket Unix groups more strongly â€” Watchman will now refuse to start
  if it couldn't gain the right group memberships, as can happen for sites that
  are experiencing intermittent LDAP connectivity problems.
* pywatchman now officially supports Python 3. pywatchman will return Unicode
  strings (possibly with surrogate escapes) by default, but can optionally return
  bytestrings. Note that on Python 3, pywatchman requires Watchman 4.8 and above.
  The Python 2 interface and requirements remain unchanged.
* Prior to 4.8, methods on the Java WatchmanClient that returned
	ListenableFutures would swallow exceptions and hang in an unfinished state
	under situations like socket closure or thread death.  This has been fixed, and
	now ListenableFutures propagate exception conditions immediately.  (Note that
	this is typically unrecoverable, and users should create a new WatchmanClient
	to re-establish communication with Watchman.)  See #412.
* The minimum Java version for the Watchman Java client has always been 1.7,
	but it was incorrectly described to be 1.6.  The Java client's build file has
	been fixed accordingly.
* Watchman was converted from C to C++.  The conversion exposed several
	concurrency bugs, all of which have now been fixed.
* Subscription queries are now executed in the context of the client thread,
	which means that subscriptions are dispatched in parallel.  Previously,
	subscriptions would be serially dispatched and block the disk IO thread.
* Triggers are now dispatched in parallel and waits are managed in their own
	threads (one thread per trigger).  This improves concurrency and resolves a
	couple of waitpid related issues where watchman may not reap spawned children
	in a timely fashion, or may spin on CPU until another child is spawned.
* Fixed an object lifecycle management issue that could cause a crash when
  aging out old/transient files.
* Implement an upgraded wire protocol, BSERv2, on the server and in pywatchman.
	BSERv2 can carry information about string encoding over the wire. This lets
	pywatchman convert to Unicode strings on Python 3. Clients and servers know how
	to  transparently fall back to BSERv1.
* OS X: we no longer use socket activation when registering with launchd.
  This was the source of some upgrade problems for mac Homebrew users.

### Watchman 4.7.0 (2016-09-10)

* Reduced memory usage by 40%
* Queries can now run with a shared lock.  It is recommended that clients
  move away from the `n:FOO` style server side named cursor clockspecs to
  take full advantage of this.
* Added new `glob` generator as a walking strategy for queries.  This
  allows watchman to evaluate globs in the most efficient manner.  Our
  friends in the Buck project have already integrated this into their
  `BUCK` file parsing to evaluate globs without touching the filesystem!
* Added `"case_sensitive": true` option to queries to force matches to
  happen in a case sensitive manner, even if the watched root is on
  a case insensitive filesystem.  This is used to accelerate certain
  types of internal traversal: if we know that a path is case sensitive
  we can perform an `O(1)` lookup where we would otherwise have to perform
  an `O(number-of-directory-entries)` scan and compare.
* Fixed a race condition during subscription initiation that could emit
  incorrect clock values.
* Fixed spurious over-notification for parent directories of changed files
  on Mac.
* Fixed some reliability issues on Windows

### Watchman 4.6.0 (2016-07-09)

* Improved I/O scheduling when processing recursive deletes and deep directory
  rename operations.
* Improved performance of the `ignore_dirs` configuration option on OS X and
  Windows systems.  We take advantage of an undocumented (but supported!)
  API to further accelerate this for the first 8 entries in the `ignore_dirs`
  on OS X.  Users that depend on this configuration to avoid recrawls will
  want to review and prioritize their most active build dirs to the front
  of the `ignore_dirs` specified in their `.watchmanconfig` file.
* Added an optional recrawl recovery strategy for OS X that will attempt to
  resync from the fseventsd journal rather than performing a full filesystem
  walk.  This is currently disabled by default but will likely be enabled
  by default in the next Watchman release.  You can enable this by setting
  `fsevents_try_resync: true` in either `/etc/watchman.json` or your
  `.watchmanconfig`.  This should reduce the frequency of recrawl warnings
  for some users/workloads, and also improves I/O for users with extremely
  large trees.
* Fixed accidental exponential time complexity issue with recursive deletes
  and deep directory rename operations on case-insensitive filesystems (such as
  OS X).  This manifested as high CPU utilization for extended periods of time.
* Added support for allowing non-owner access to a Watchman instance.  Only
  the owner is authorized to create or delete watches.  Non-owners can view
  information about existing watches.  Access control is based on unix domain
  socket permissions.  The new but not yet documented configuration options
  `sock_group` and `sock_access` can be used to control this new behavior.
* Added support for inetd-style socket activation of the watchman service.
  [this commit includes a sample configuration for systemd](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/commit/2985377eaf8c8538b28fae9add061b67991a87c2).
* Added the `symlink_target` field to the stored metadata for files.  This
  holds the text of the symbolic link for symlinks.  You can test whether it
  is supported by a watchman server using the capability name
  `field-symlink_target`.
* Fixed an issue where watchman may not reap child processes spawned by
  triggers.
* Fixed an issue where watchman may block forever during shutdown if there
  are other connected clients.
* Added `hint_num_dirs` configuration option.


### pywatchman 1.4.0 (????-??-??)

(These changes have not yet been released to pypi)

* Added immutable version of data results to bser.  This is cheaper to build
  from a serialized bser representation than the mutable version and is
  better suited to large result sets received from watchman.
* Fixed a number of misc. portability issues
* Added Python 3.x support

### Watchman 4.5.0 (2016-02-18)

* Fixed an inotify race condition for non-atomic directory replacements
  that was introduced in Watchman 4.4.

### Watchman 4.4.0 (2016-02-02)

* Added state-enter and state-leave commands can allow subscribers to more
  intelligently settle/coalesce events around hg update or builds.
* Fixed an issue where subscriptions could double-notify for the same events.
* Fixed an issue where subscriptions that never match any files add
  O(all-observed-files) CPU cost to every subscription dispatch

### Watchman 4.3.0 (2015-12-14)

* Improved handling of case insensitive renames; halved the memory usage
  and doubled crawl speed on OS X.

### Watchman 4.2.0 (2015-12-08)

* Increased strictness of checks for symlinks; rather than just checking
  whether the leaf of a directory tree is a symlink, we now check each
  component down from the root of the watch.  This improves detection
  and processing for directory-to-symlink (and vice versa) transitions.
* Increased priority of the watchman process on OS X.

### pywatchman 1.3.0 (2015-10-22)

* Added `watchman-make` and `watchman-wait` commands
* Added pure python implementation of BSER

### Watchman 4.1.0 (2015-10-20)

* Fixed an issue where symlink size was always reported as 0 on OS X
  using the new bulkstat functionality

### Watchman 4.0.0 (2015-10-19)

* Fixed an issue where a directory that was replaced by a symlink would
  cause a symlink traversal instead of correctly updating the type of the
  node and marking the children removed.
* Fixed a debugging log line that was emitted at the wrong log level on
  every directory traversal.

### Watchman 3.9.0 (2015-10-12)

* Fixed an issue where dir renames on OS X could cause us to lose track of
  the files inside the renamed dir
* Fixed an issue where dir deletes and replacements on Linux could cause us
  to lose track of the files inside the replaced dir (similar to the OS X issue
  above in manifestation, but a different root cause).
* Improved (re)crawl speed for dirs with more than a couple of entries on average
  (improvement can be up to 5x for dirs with up to 64 entries on average).
  You may now tune the `hint_num_files_per_dir` setting in your
  `.watchmanconfig` to better match your tree.  [More details](
  /watchman/docs/config.html#hint_num_files_per_dir)
* Improved (re)crawl speed on OS X 10.10 and later by using `getattrlistbulk`.
  This allows us to improve the data:syscall ratio during crawling and can
  improve throughput by up to 40% for larger trees.
* Add optional `sync_timeout` to the `clock` command
* Avoid accidentally passing descriptors other than the stdio streams
  when we spawn the watchman service.
* Fixed a race condition where we could start two sets of watcher threads
  for the same dir if two clients issue a `watch` or `watch-project` at
  the same time
* Added a helpful error for a tmux + launchd issue on OS X

### Watchman 3.8.0 (2015-09-14)

* Improved latency of processing kernel notifications. It should now be far
  less likely to run into an notification queue overflow.
* Improved idle behavior. There were a couple of places where watchman would
  wake up more often than was strictly needed and these have now been fixed.
  This is mostly of interest to laptop users on battery power.
* Improved inotify move tracking.  Some move operations could cause watchman
  to become confused and trigger a recrawl.  This has now been resolved.
* Hardened statedir and permissions. There was a possibility of a symlink
  attack and this has now been mitigated by re-structuring the statedir layout.
* Fixed a possible deadlock in the idle watch reaper
* Fixed an issue where the watchman -p log-level debug could drop log
  notifications in the CLI
* Disabled the IO-throttling-during-crawl that we added in 3.7. It proved to
  be more harmful than beneficial.
* `-j` CLI option now accepts either JSON or BSER encoded command on stdin
* Added [capabilities](/watchman/docs/capabilities.html) to the server,
  and added the [capabilityCheck](/watchman/docs/cmd/version.html#capabilityCheck)
  method to the python and node clients.

### pywatchman 1.2.0 (2015-08-15)

* Added the `capabilityCheck` method
* Added `SocketTimeout` exception to distinguish timeouts from protocol level
  exceptions

### fb-watchman 1.3.0 for node (2015-08-15)

* Added the [capabilityCheck](/watchman/docs/nodejs.html#checking-for-watchman-availability) method.

### pywatchman 1.0.0 (2015-08-06)

* First official pypi release, thanks to [@kwlzn](https://github.com/kwlzn)
  for setting up the release machinery for this.

### Watchman 3.7.0 (2015-08-05)

(Watchman 3.6.0 wasn't formally released)

* Fixed bug where `query match` on `foo*.java` with `wholename` scope
  would incorrectly match `foo/bar/baz.java`.
* Added `src/**/*.java` recursive glob pattern support to `query match`.
* Added options dictionary to `query`'s `match` operator.
* Added `includedotfiles` option to `query match` to include files
  whose names start with `.`.
* Added `noescape` option to `query match` to make `\` match literal `\`.
* We'll now automatically age out and stop watches. See [idle_reap_age_seconds](
/watchman/docs/config.html#idle_reap_age_seconds) for more information.
* `watch-project` will now try harder to re-use an existing watch and avoid
  creating an overlapping watch.
* Reduce I/O priority during crawling on systems that support this
* Fixed issue with the `long long` data type in the python BSER module

### fb-watchman 1.2.0 for node (2015-07-11)

* Updated the node client to more gracefully handle `undefined` values in
  objects when serializing them; we now omit keys whose values are `undefined`
  rather than throw an exception.

### Watchman 3.5.0 (2015-06-29)

* Fix the version number reported by watchman.

### Watchman 3.4.0 (2015-06-29)

* `trigger` now supports an optional `relative_root` argument. The trigger is
  evaluated with respect to this subdirectory. See
  [trigger](/watchman/docs/cmd/trigger.html#relative-roots) for more.

### fb-watchman 1.1.0 for node (2015-06-25)

* Updated the node client to handle 64-bit integer values using the
  [node-int64](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-int64).  These are most
  likely to show up if your query fields include `size` and you have files
  larger than 2GB in your watched root.

### fb-watchman 1.0.0 for node (2015-06-23)

* Updated the node client to support [BSER](/watchman/docs/bser.html)
  encoding, fixing a quadratic performance issue in the JSON stream
  decoder that was used previously.

### Watchman 3.3.0 (2015-06-22)

* `query` and `subscribe` now support an optional `relative_root`
  argument. Inputs and outputs are evaluated with respect to this
  subdirectory. See
  [File Queries](/watchman/docs/file-query.html#relative-roots) for more.
