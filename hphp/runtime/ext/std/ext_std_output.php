/** This function will turn output buffering on. While output buffering is
 * active no output is sent from the script (other than headers), instead the
 * output is stored in an internal buffer.  The contents of this internal
 * buffer may be copied into a string variable using ob_get_contents(). To
 * output what is stored in the internal buffer, use ob_end_flush().
 * Alternatively, ob_end_clean() will silently discard the buffer contents.
 * Warning  Some web servers (e.g. Apache) change the working directory of a
 * script when calling the callback function. You can change it back by e.g.
 * chdir(dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'])) in the callback function.
 * Output buffers are stackable, that is, you may call ob_start() while
 * another ob_start() is active. Just make sure that you call ob_end_flush()
 * the appropriate number of times. If multiple output callback functions are
 * active, output is being filtered sequentially through each of them in
 * nesting order.
 * @param mixed $output_callback - An optional output_callback function may be
 * specified. This function takes a string as a parameter and should return a
 * string. The function will be called when the output buffer is flushed
 * (sent) or cleaned (with ob_flush(), ob_clean() or similar function) or when
 * the output buffer is flushed to the browser at the end of the request. When
 * output_callback is called, it will receive the contents of the output
 * buffer as its parameter and is expected to return a new output buffer as a
 * result, which will be sent to the browser. If the output_callback is not a
 * callable function, this function will return FALSE.  If the callback
 * function has two parameters, the second parameter is filled with a
 * bit-field consisting of PHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_START, PHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_CONT
 * and PHP_OUTPUT_HANDLER_END.  If output_callback returns FALSE original
 * input is sent to the browser.  The output_callback parameter may be
 * bypassed by passing a NULL value.  ob_end_clean(), ob_end_flush(),
 * ob_clean(), ob_flush() and ob_start() may not be called from a callback
 * function. If you call them from callback function, the behavior is
 * undefined. If you would like to delete the contents of a buffer, return ""
 * (a null string) from callback function. You can't even call functions using
 * the output buffering functions like print_r($expression, true) or
 * highlight_file($filename, true) from a callback function.  In PHP 4.0.4,
 * ob_gzhandler() was introduced to facilitate sending gz-encoded data to web
 * browsers that support compressed web pages. ob_gzhandler() determines what
 * type of content encoding the browser will accept and will return its output
 * accordingly.
 * @param int $chunk_size - If the optional parameter chunk_size is passed,
 * the buffer will be flushed after any output call which causes the buffer's
 * length to equal or exceed chunk_size. Default value 0 means that the
 * function is called only in the end, other special value 1 sets chunk_size
 * to 4096.
 * @param bool $erase - If the optional parameter erase is set to FALSE, the
 * buffer will not be deleted until the script finishes. This causes that
 * flushing and cleaning functions would issue a notice and return FALSE if
 * called.
 * @return bool - Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.

/** Flushes the write buffers of PHP and whatever backend PHP is using (CGI, a

 * buffering scheme of your web server and it has no effect on any client-side
 * buffering in the browser. It also doesn't affect PHP's userspace output
 * buffering mechanism. This means you will have to call both ob_flush() and
 * flush() to flush the ob output buffers if you are using those.  Several
 * servers, especially on Win32, will still buffer the output from your script
 * until it terminates before transmitting the results to the browser.  Server
 * modules for Apache like mod_gzip may do buffering of their own that will
 * cause flush() to not result in data being sent immediately to the client.
 * Even the browser may buffer its input before displaying it. Netscape, for
 * example, buffers text until it receives an end-of-line or the beginning of
 * a tag, and it won't render tables until the </table> tag of the outermost
 * table is seen.  Some versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer will only
 * start to display the page after they have received 256 bytes of output, so
 * you may need to send extra whitespace before flushing to get those browsers
 * to display the page.
