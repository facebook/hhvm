  Use setjmp/longjmp for long control transfers.  This is the most portable
  option for long control transfers.

  The downside of setjmp/longjmp is that signal mask saving behavior is not
  specified and varies between platforms.  Signal mask saving may have a
  significant performance impact so you may want to force a specific provider
  if performance matters for your application.  (This is the case for OSX,
  for instance.)

  Removed in Duktape 1.5.0: edit duk_config.h directly.
