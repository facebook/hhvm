## Issues

Squangle is currently only supported as a dependency of HHVM, not as a
standalone project.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.
