# fixme.py -- Adds HH_FIXME annotations in your code to clean up after a new
#             check in the typechecker or after an upgrade. Takes two arguments:
#               1) A Filename, which is the output of `hh_client --json`.
#               2) An explanation to insert into each "fixme" comment.

# Known problems:
#
# - Will insert HH_FIXME comments in the body of XHP elements, where they will
#   be rendered to the page. Thankfully the typechecker does not accept them at
#   this location, and so it won't actually silence the error and can be fixed
#   manually.
