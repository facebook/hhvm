exception Diagnostics_mismatch of string

(** Accept a documented active bug only when [check] raises
    [Diagnostics_mismatch] or [Internal_typechecker_error] and [matches] accepts
    that exception. Match the specific diagnostic, file, and comparison side,
    or the specific internal error; unrelated exceptions always propagate.

    If [check] succeeds, fail with [bug] and instructions to remove the wrapper
    and keep the ordinary correctness check. [bug] should identify the task or
    bug family. The check usually calls [run]. *)
val expect_known_fanout_bug :
  bug:string -> matches:(exn -> bool) -> (unit -> unit) -> unit

(** Checks all initial files to establish the baseline, executes the iterations,
    and compares the last invocation's diagnostics with a fresh all-files check
    of the final disk. There is no extra incremental check before comparison.

    Both runs use independent child processes started with [Daemon.spawn].
    Test binaries using this harness must call [Daemon.check_entry_point] before
    starting their tests. The runner uses real temporary files, the Rust provider
    backend, embedded HHI files, and no worker processes. Source files are never
    executed by HHVM.

    Raises [Internal_typechecker_error] if the baseline, any iteration, or the
    fresh check reports an internal typechecker error, including caught exceptions
    and invariant violations. These are rejected before the next iteration can
    clear them or the final comparison can accept matching internal errors.
    Raises [Diagnostics_mismatch] on disagreement, or fails if a child fails.
    Diagnostics are compared without temporary root paths or ordering. *)
val run : scenario -> unit

(** Run a scenario that reproduces a known bug, requiring exactly the listed
    incremental and fresh-check diagnostics. Each tuple is the repository-relative
    filename, error code, and primary message. Positions and reason messages are
    ignored; diagnostic order does not matter and duplicate entries are retained.

    Unmatched diagnostic differences and internal errors propagate. If the checks
    agree, fail with [bug] and instructions to remove the wrapper. *)
