.TH HACKIFICATOR 1

.SH NAME
hackificator \- convert PHP code to Hack

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hackificator
.I DIRECTORY

.SH DESCRIPTION

.BR hackificator (1)
recursively converts
.I DIRECTORY
from PHP code into Hack code. The
.I DIRECTORY
must have already been set up as a Hack project and have
.BR hh_client (1)
run inside it.

This conversion process simply converts the headers of files from the PHP header
to the Hack header, making only very trivial syntactic tweaks along the way.  It
does not add type annotations or change code to take advantage of any Hack
features.

See
.I http://docs.hhvm.com/manual/en/install.hack.conversion.php
for detailed information and documentation on the PHP to Hack conversion
tools.

.SH BUGS
The Hack language is part of the HHVM project. Known bugs can be found at that
tracker, and new ones should be reported there as well:
