description: >
  Define traceback collection depth.  A large number causes tracedata to be
  larger, taking more time to create and consuming more memory.  A small
  number makes tracebacks less useful.

  When tracebacks are disabled this option affects .fileName and .lineNumber
  blaming.  Error augmentation code won't look deeper than this value to find
  a function to blame for error .fileName / .lineNumber.
