/**
 * MemoryManager categorizes memory usage into 4 categories and maintain some
 * of them with different strategy:
 *
 *  1. Fixed size objects: de/allocated by SmartAllocators, these objects have
 *     exactly the same size.
 *  2. Interally malloc-ed and variable sized memory held by fixed size
 *     objects, for example, StringData's m_data. These memory can be backed up
 *     and restored by LinearAllocator.
 *  3. Unsafe pointers held by fixed size objects, for example, ObjectData*
 *     held by Object. These pointers point to some external memory that's out
 *     of the control of MemoryManager, and therefore they are only interfaced
 *     through UnsafePointer class to make sure they are protected when these
 *     pointers are backed up to LinearAllocator.
 *  4. Freelance memory, malloced by extensions or STL classes, that are
 *     completely out of MemoryManager's control.
