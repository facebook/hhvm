/// DeclProvider is an interface for requesting named decl data required
/// for bytecode compilation.
///
/// The provider is supplied by the client requesting a bytecode
/// compilation. This client may wish to cache the compiled bytecode and
/// will record the various symbols observed during compilation for the
/// purpose of generating a cache key.
///
/// Methods are provided for each distinct kind of name (starting with
/// types, for now).
///
/// A special depth parameter is supplied to the client indicating how many
/// levels of get requests were traversed to arrive at the current
/// request. It may be used in an implementation specified manner to improve
/// caching.
///
/// As an example consider these source files:
///
/// a.php:
///
///   <?hh
///
///   function foo(MyType $bar): void { ... }
///
/// b.php:
///
///     <?hh
///
///     type MyType = Bar<Biz, Buz>;
///
/// If while compiling `a.php` a request is made for `MyType` the depth
/// will be zero as the symbol is referenced directly from `a.php`. The
/// shallow decl returned will be for a type alias to a `Bar`.
///
/// Should the compiler now request `Bar` the depth should be one, as the
/// lookup was an indirect reference. Likewise `Biz` and `Buz` would be
/// requested with a depth of one.
///
/// Further traversal into the type of Bar should it too be a type alias
/// would be at a depth of two.
///
