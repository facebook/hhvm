 * states are not reachable.
 *
 * The `unreachable' flag means we've produced this state from analysis, but
 * the program cannot reach this program position.  This flag has two uses:
 *
 *    o It allows us to determine arbitrary mid-block positions where code
 *      becomes unreachable, and eliminate that code in optimize.cpp.
 *
 *    o HHBC invariants can complicate removing unreachable code in FPI
 *      regions---see the rules in bytecode.specification.  Inside FPI regions,
 *      we still do abstract interpretation of the unreachable code, but this
 *      flag is used when merging states to allow the interpreter to analyze
 *      blocks that are unreachable without pessimizing states for reachable
 *      blocks that would've been their successors.
 *
 * One other note: having the interpreter visit blocks when they are
 * unreachable still potentially merges types into object properties that
 * aren't possible at runtime.  We're only doing this to handle FPI regions for
 * now, but it's not ideal.
