final class Map
**Prefer `dict` over `Map`**. If you need reference semantics,
you can wrap the `dict` in an `Ref`.

`Map` is an ordered dictionary-style collection. HHVM provides a native
implementation for this class. The PHP class definition below is not
actually used at run time; it is simply provided for the typechecker and for
developer reference.

Like all objects in PHP, `Map`s have reference-like semantics. When a caller
passes a `Map` to a callee, the callee can modify the `Map` and the caller
will see the changes. `Map`s do not have "copy-on-write" semantics.

`Map`s preserve insertion order of key/value pairs. When iterating over a
`Map`, the key/value pairs appear in the order they were inserted. Also,
`Map`s do not automagically convert integer-like `string` keys (ex. `"123"`)
into integer keys.

`Map`s only support `int` keys and `string` keys. If a key of a different
type is used, an exception will be thrown.

`Map`s support `$m[$k]` style syntax for getting and setting values by key.
`Map`s also support `isset($m[$k])` and `empty($m[$k])` syntax, and they
provide similar semantics as arrays. Adding an element with square bracket
syntax `[]` is supported either by providing a key between the brackets or
a `Pair` on the right-hand side. e.g.,
`$m[$k] = $v` is supported
`$m[] = Pair {$k, $v}` is supported
`$m[] = $v` is not supported.

`Map`s do not support iterating while new keys are being added or elements
are being removed. When a new key is added or an element is removed, all
iterators that point to the `Map` shall be considered invalid.
