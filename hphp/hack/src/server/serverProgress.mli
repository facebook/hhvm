  OVERVIEW OF STREAMING ERRORS FILE

  Errors is a file at /tmp/hh_server/<repo>/errors.bin which is written
  by server during a typecheck. The file is first created when the server
  starts its first typecheck, gets errors appended to it as the typecheck
  discovers them, is unlinked and then another one with the same name
  created each time the server starts another typecheck, and the file is finally
  unlinked upon server exit. A "typecheck" can be thought of as a typecheck of the
  entire program, and hence the errors file will contain every error reported in WWW.
  But in reality the server does tricks to typecheck a smaller number of files just
  so long as it still manages to report every error into the file.

  Therefore: a client can at any time open an file descriptor to this file,
  and `tail -f -n +1` (i.e. read from the start and then follow) to follow
  the typecheck that is currently underway or most recently completed, from its
  start to its end. It will still be able to read the file descriptor through
  to its end even if, in the meantime, a new typecheck has started and the old
  file has been unlinked. Note that a given file-descriptor will only ever point
  to a file which monitonically grows.

  The server can have its typecheck interrupted. Some interruptions like watchman
  will cause the current typecheck to be cancelled, then a new typecheck started.
  In this case the existing errors file will be unlinked, a new errors file created
  for the new typecheck, and a sentinel will be written into the old file descriptor
  to show that it ended before completing. Other interruptions, e.g. from
  `hh --type-at-pos`, will have no effect: the current typecheck file can continue
  being read just fine. If a client reads a file descriptor on its sentinel, that is
  a guarantee that a new errors file is already in place and can be opened (or,
  if no errors file exists, that can only be because the server has terminated).

  If the file does not exist, the client knows that either there is no server, or there
  is one but it has not yet started typechecking (it might still be loading saved state).
  In either case it is appropriate for the client to clientConnect {autostart_server=true}
  in the normal way, until it establishes a connection to the server, and then it can
  wait for the errors file.


  SEMANTICS OF ERRORS-FILE CONTENTS

  * An errors-file is tied to a particular watchman clock value. It reflects
    all file-changes that happened prior to the clock. (As to whether it reflects
    any file-changes that happened after the clock, that is impossible to tell.)
  * As mentioned above, when the errors-file is complete, it contains the full
    set of errors that hh_server knows about for the project.
  * The error file is in a binary format consisting of a header followed by a series of
    Errors.error list Relative_path.map along with timestamp,
    followed by an "end sentinel" if the typecheck has finished or been interrupted.
    Let's call each of these maps an error report. Each encompasses
    several files, and for each file it has a list of errors. Currently we make
    one report for all "duplicate name" errors across the project if any, followed by
    one report per batch that had errors. This means that a file might be mentioned
    twice, once in a "duplicate name" report, once later. This will change in future
    so that each file is reported only once.
  * It currently does not write empty reports, though that might change in future
    (e.g. we might decide to write "no errors in file a.php" for a file which
    previously did have errors).
  * Within a single report, the error list has been sorted and de-duped.


  LIFECYCLE SEMANTICS OF PRODUCING AND CONSUMING THE ERRORS-FILE

  The code that produces errors-file lives in ServerMain.ml (which registers an on-exit
  hook to delete the file), ServerTypeCheck.ml (to manage the previous and new
  errors-file immediately before and after a typecheck is performed),
  and typing_check_service.ml (to make the actual error reports).
  1. When hh_server is launched, it either eventually exits or eventually writes
  an errors.bin file with some clock value that came at or after its launch.
  2. When files on disk are changed that pass FilesToIgnore.watchman_server_expression_terms
  and FindUtils.post_watchman_filter, then eventually either a new errors.bin will
  be written which reflects the clock after those files, or eventually it will terminate.

  These invariants imply how the client should connect:
  1. If there's no errors.bin, then doing an RPC connect to the server that succeeds
  means that it's fine to just wait around waiting for an errors.bin to succeed.
  (Except for one vulnerability: if the server handles the RPC but then crashes
  before starting its first check).
  2. If there is an errors.bin but files have changed on disk since error's watchclock,
  it's fine for the client to just wait until a new errors.bin gets created.
