Semdiff - semantic differencing for hhas
========================================

This is a technical overview of how the semdiff tool works.

Version 0.2

Introduction
============

Semdiff is a standalone testing tool for comparing the hhas output of the hack
and hhvm compilers on individual source files. Semdiff attempts to establish
that two hhas files are behaviourally equivalent, i.e. will produce the same
observable output in all contexts. It does not take differences in resource
usage (time, memory) into account. Semdiff's analysis is at the level of
individual functions/methods. For each pair of functions, it either establishes
equivalence or fails, which may either be because the functions really are
observationally different, or because semdiff's analysis is insufficiently
powerful to show equivalence. The intention is that semdiff is sound - it should
report equivalence only if the functions really will always produce the same
observable results. For obvious computability reasons, semdiff is not complete
(nor anywhere near it) when run on arbitrary hhas files. However, because the
hack compiler was carefully written to produce output that is "essentially" the
same as hhvm's, we *should* be able to establish equivalence of the compilers'
outputs on any hack source file. We are just aiming to quotient by "trivial"
differences.

In the case that semdiff fails, it reports the positions in the two programs,
and the assumed relation between their local variables and exception contexts,
for which it was unable to establish equivalence. It also produces a *syntactic*
diff of the two functions.

Semdiff first parses the two files, producing elements of the Hhbc_program.t
datatype. Corresponding functions and classes in the programs are then compared.
This comparison involves checking equality of flags, parameter names and types
and so on, which is boring but straightforward. The interesting part is the way
in which function bodies - sequences of Hhbc_ast.instructions - are compared, as
it is here that there is a difference between syntactic and semantic
comparisons.

The basic idea
==============

We start with an oversimplified explanation, which we'll refine later.

Semdiff is essentially a prover for a very simple version of Relational Hoare
Logic [1]. Assertions in the logic are, roughly, conjunctions of equalities
between unnamed locals on the two sides, like this (the convention is that
unprimed identifiers refer to the first program and primed ones to the second):

phi = (_1 = _2') /\ (_2 = _5') /\ (_3 = _3')

Unnamed locals are used as temporaries by the compilers; they do not appear in
the source program. We do not currently deal with non-trivial relations between
named locals because hhbc allows them to be accessed via dynamically computed
string names (e.g. VGetN), which we cannot easily track. The meaning of the
assertion above is a relation between the states on the two sides that says
local 1 on the left is equal to local 2 on the right, etc., *and* that
everything else (evaluation stack, heap, named variables and parameters, the
rest of the program, IO history,...) is equal. The relation does not constrain
the values of unmentioned unnamed locals (though see later for the truth here).

Given two sequences of instructions (prog and prog') and two entry points (pc
and pc'), with the same lists of parameters, we attempt to show that starting
prog at pc and prog at pc' will yield equivalent results, in the sense that
either both executions will diverge, or they will return identical (normal or
exceptional) results to their callers, and in either case, the sequences of
intermediate calls to other functions and input/output operations will be the
same. In symbols, our initial goal is to show a judgment

init = |- pc,pc' : [true]

where true is the assertion with no conjuncts, and [phi] is the relation on
program counters that relates pc and pc' iff the machine configurations
<prog,pc,s> and <prog',pc',s'> yield equivalent behaviour for any states s and
s' related by phi. (We usually leave prog and prog' implicit when we write
judgments, since they don't change during a proof.)

We maintain a set of judgments that have been "assumed" and a set of judgments
that are "todo". If we can prove all the things in todo then all the things in
assumed will be true. To begin with we just have an init judgement for each
corresponding pair of entry points, which always include pc=0, pc'=0 (the others
arise from default value initializers, if there are any). We proceed by picking
some pc,pc' : [phi] from todo, looking at the instructions prog.pc and prog'.pc'
and on the basis of what we find there, either
 (1) failing: we can't show equivalence, or
 (2) succeeding on this goal: we have established pc,pc':[phi], so go back and
 pick something else from todo, or
 (3) adding pc,pc':[phi] to assumed, and generating new obligations that are
 added to todo.

If there's nothing left to pick from todo, we're done and have established
everything in assumed, including our initial goals.

A crucial part of this algorithm is that if the thing we are trying to
established is implied by what we have already assumed, then we are in case (2)-
we've nothing more to do for that goal. Taken with the fact that we add things
that we are trying to prove to assumed in case (3), one could be forgiven for
wondering whether we're indulging in circular reasoning. The answer is that we
are, but it's the good, sound kind! That relies on the fact that [.] is suitably
well-behaved, and can be explained using step-indexing, coinduction, or domain
theory [2,3,4], but I'll omit the the details here - it's essentially the same
as the justification for loop invariants in ordinary Hoare Logic.

The details of how we decide whether we are in case (1), (2) or (3), and what we
do in case (3), can be expressed using inference rules for deducing judgments
Gamma |- pc,pc':[phi], where Gamma is the set of assumptions. For example

 prog.pc = RetV   prog'.pc' = RetV
 ---------------------------------
      Gamma |- pc,pc' : [phi]

This is a case (2) rule. It says that if both program counters point to RetV
instructions, then we will get equal behaviour if the states are related by any
phi, and irrespective of Gamma. The reason this is valid is that any phi in our
assertion language represents a relation that says that the two evaluation
stacks are equal, and so are the heaps and the rest of the program. So we'll
return the same value to the same code on either side (or produce the same
error). There are similar rules for Exit and Fatal.

The rule for using an assumption is straightforward, and has no premisses:

   -------------------------------------
   Gamma; pc,pc':[phi] |- pc,pc' : [phi]

and we can also use logical implication:

  Gamma |- pc,pc':[phi1]     phi2 => phi1
  ---------------------------------------
         Gamma |- pc,pc':[phi2]

The contravariance is caused by [.]: if we get equal behaviour when the states
are related by phi1, and phi2 logically implies phi1, then we get equal
behaviour when the states are related by phi2. (This is like a form of Hoare
Logic for continuation-passing, in which we only have preconditions.)

Here's an example with a real premiss:

 prog.pc = Dup    prog'.pc'=Dup    Gamma; pc,pc':[phi] |- pc+1,pc'+1 : [phi]
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
                          Gamma |- pc,pc' : [phi]

This is an example of case (3). If both pcs point to Dup, then we'll get equal
behaviour for phi-related states if we can show that we get equal behaviour from
the successor pcs from phi-related states. Note that we add the extra assumption
pc,pc':[phi] to Gamma for the subproof. The assertion phi is the same because we
haven't touched any locals, and if the stacks were the same before the Dup
instructions, they'll be the same after as well.

Similarly:

 prog.pc = String s  prog'.pc'=String s  Gamma; pc,pc':[phi] |- pc+1,pc'+1:[phi]
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              Gamma |- pc,pc' : [phi]

Note that the string literal s has to be the same on both sides for the rule to
apply. There are many "boring" rules of this form for instructions that don't
affect locals or control flow in an interesting way.

Here's a rule dealing with an instruction that reads an unnamed local variable:

 prog.pc = CGetL _l     prog'.pc'= CGetL _l'     phi => _l = _l'
 Gamma; pc,pc':[phi] |- pc+1,pc'+1:[phi]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
                        Gamma |- pc,pc' : [phi]

Now we're using the relation phi. The two CGetL instructions will behave the
same provided that the contents of the potentially different local variables on
the two sides are known to be equal. Other instructions that read are dealt with
in the same way.

The way we ever get any relations to use is from instructions that write to
local variables, e.g.

 prog.pc = SetL _l     prog'.pc' = SetL _l'
 Gamma; pc,pc':[phi] |- pc+1,pc'+1:[phi + _l=_l']
--------------------------------------------------
               Gamma |- pc,pc' : [phi]

Here, phi+_l=_l' means phi with any existing equalities involving _l or _l'
removed, and the equality _l=_l' conjoined. When we arrive at pc,pc', the two
stacks, and in particular their top values, will be equal. So at pc+1,pc'+1, we
additionally know _l=_l' because we've just assigned the same value to them. But
it's important not to forget the removal, since we might also have known _l=_l''
at pc,pc', but that could be invalidated by the SetL _l.

Some instructions both read and write:

 prog.pc = IncDecL(_l,PreInc)    prog'.pc'=IncDecL(_l',PreInc)
 phi => _l=_l'
 Gamma; pc,pc':[phi] |- pc+1,pc'+1:[phi + _l=_l']
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
                       Gamma |- pc,pc' : [phi]

We have to check that _l and _l' are equal before the operation, and assert that
they are equal afterwards. Note that it isn't sound to just leave phi alone in
the premiss, because (as above) other equalities involving _l or _l' might have
been invalidated.

Control flow instructions can sometimes be dealt with one side at a time:

 prog.pc = Jmp L   prog.pc2 = L:   Gamma; pc,pc':[phi] |- pc2,pc':[phi]
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                             Gamma |- pc,pc' : [phi]

we just follow the jump instruction on the left and carry on comparing. This
allows the control flow on the two sides to be slightly different.

But conditional branches have to be paired up, which generates two further
obligations:

  prog.pc = JmpZ L        prog.pc2 = L:
  prog'.pc' = JmpZ L'     prog'.pc2' = L':
  Gamma; pc,pc':[phi] |- pc+1,pc'+1 : [phi]
  Gamma; pc,pc':[phi] |- pc2,pc2' : [phi]
 ----------------------------------------------------
                 Gamma |- pc,pc' : [phi]

Because we know the stacks are equal, we know that either both JmpZs will fall
through, or they'll both take the branch, and we have to check for equivalent
behaviour in both cases to know we get equivalent behaviour from the jump
instructions. Switch statements generate an obligation for each case.

We say two function bodies are equivalent if we can prove |- entry,entry' :
[true] for each pair of entry points entry, entry'. The entry points we check
are 0,0 (the start of each function) and DV_n, DV_n' for each matching pair of
default value initializers. (Remark: we discovered a bug in both compilers here,
relating to when parameters are VerifyParam'd in initializers. This should be
fixed by restricting the source language.)

Things we don't do and things we assume
=======================================

The VGetN instruction gets the value of the local variable whose name is given
by the string on the top of the stack. Since we're not tracking the actual
values on the stack, we don't know what variable that is. We assume that it can
never be one of the unnamed locals (compiler temporaries). If that assumption is
false, then what we're doing is unsound. The presence of VGetN and similar
instructions is why we don't allow interesting correspondences between named
locals (such as parameters).

Similarly, if VGetL is applied to an unnamed local, we just fail, except in
certain special cases. In practice this doesn't seem to happen very often, which
is good.

Specials
========

The general analysis described above can cope with different uses of local
variables as arise from different register allocators, different orderings of
basic blocks, and minor variations in control flow, such as jumps to jumps. But
it doesn't track anything interesting about actual values, so there are many
valid equivalences that it can't prove. We could make the whole logic more
expressive, but for now we instead add a number of ad hoc peephole equivalences
corresponding to semantically equivalent code patterns we observe in the output
of the two compilers. These are actually expressed as additional rules following
the same format as those given above, but it is more convenient to explain most
of them as extra equalities on programs. Obviously, the intention is that these
really are semantic equivalences.

Set-Pop-Get
-----------

 SetL l; PopC; PushL l  =   Unset l

The sequence on the left copies the top of the stack to local l, pops the stack,
and then pushes the contents of l to the stack and unsets l. Provided that the
code verifies (so the stack can't underflow), this is equivalent to just
unsetting l.

Not-Jmp
-------

 Not; JmpZ L = JmpNZ L
 Not; JmpNZ L = JmpZ L

I think this one's self explanatory.

String-Concat-Concat
--------------------

 String s; Concat; Concat  =  Concat; String s; Concat

These sequences both take a stack looking like [s1 s2] to [s1.s2.s] because
string concatenation is associative.

(Planned: a slightly richer set of patterns for string operations.)

FPassL
------

FPassL n l pushes local l to the stack as argument n of an upcoming function
call. This might look like a simple read of l, but the semantics are actually a
bit more complicated: it behaves like CGetL if parameter n is by value, and like
VGetL if it's by reference. But we don't track what function is about to be
called, so don't know which case applies. And we don't allow VGetL on unnamed
locals. So the easy, safe thing to do would be to disallow FPassL on unnamed
locals. Unfortunately, that does occur in practice, when compiling pipes. So we
implement the following nasty-but-safe hack:

  prog.pc = FPassL n _l   prog'.pc' = FPassL n _l'
  safe_sequence(prog,pc+1)
  safe_sequence(prog',pc'+1)
  phi => _l=_l'
  Gamma; pc,pc':[phi] |- pc+1,pc'+1 : [phi + _l=_l']
 ----------------------------------------------------
                 Gamma |- pc,pc' : [phi]

where safe_sequence(prog,pc) says "there's a sequence of (only)
parameter-pushing instructions starting at pc, terminated by a call instruction
that will consume all of them and the current top of the stack". Note that we're
treating the FPassL instructions as if they might both read and write the
locals. The read is clear, and the write accounts for the possibility that the
call might modify the local if it ends up being passed by reference. I don't
actually know if that can happen, but it's conservative to assume it might. If
it can, then it won't *really* happen until the call returns, but it's safe to
pretend it could happen at the point we do the push, since all we're doing is
removing any other equalities involving _l or _l' earlier than we need to.

Fatal exit messages
-------------------

String s; Fatal op = String s'; Fatal op

So long as the op is the same, we allow different error messages.

Permutation of free variables in closures
-----------------------------------------

The order in which free variables are passed to closures shouldn't matter. So
when we're checking the code that creates a closure, we look for a sequence of
CUGetL instructions on each side, followed by a CreateCL instructions. We check
that the CUGetL sequences are equivalent up to some permutation, and then
schedule the relevant closure classes to be compared up to that permutation.

VGetL-Unset
-----------

Some nasty php-only foreach statements do generate code in which VGetL is used
with an unnamed local. But the code follows a very specific pattern and the
alias does not escape, so we implement a special pattern:

  prog,pc -> [VGetL _n; CGetL2 l; BindN; PopV; UnsetL _n]
  prog',pc' -> [VGetL _n'; CGetL2 l'; BindN; PopV; UnsetL _n']
  phi => _n = _n'
  phi => l = l'
  Gamma; pc,pc':[phi] |- pc+5, pc'+5 : [phi + unset n + unset n']
 -----------------------------------------------------------------
                    Gamma |- pc,pc' : [phi]

There are actually several variants of this pattern, including ones where
there's a CGet before the VGetL (instead of a CGetL2 afterwards), and where the
middle section does
   BaseL l,mode; BindM n, key
instead of BindN.

VGetL-RetV
----------

Another special case that appears in some code is:

  prog,pc -> [VGetL _n; RetV]
  prog',pc' -> [VGetL _n'; RetV]
  phi = _n = _n'
 --------------------------------
   Gamma |- pc,pc' : [phi]

Exceptions
==========

We now sketch how the simple model above is refined to deal with exceptions.
This reflects my understanding, based on the documentation and doing some
experiments.

HHVM has two kinds of exception-handling mechanism: faults and catches. In both
cases, a region of code is protected by a designated handler, and control
transfers to the statically closest handler (or to the parent frame if there's
no local handler) when an exception is thrown. In the case of a catch, that's
essentially all one needs to know. Further propagation is handled by explicit
throws in the catch-handler, with nested trys in the source compiling to
overlapping regions (with both a nested region and its handler being covered by
the enclosing region). In the case of faults, the propagation is more involved.
Fault handlers end with an unwind instruction, which transfers control to the
"next" handler - that associated with the region enclosing the one in which the
exception was originally raised. That in turn unwinds to its parent and so on,
stopping when the parent is a catch handler (or, as far as semdiff is concerned,
when there's no parent in the current frame). If an exception is raised in a
fault handler, that can create another chain of handlers to be unwound up.

Semdiff deals with exceptional control flow by refining the simple notion of
program counter used above, from an integer to an integer paired with a stack of
handler entry points, representing the the fault handlers that are waiting to be
unwound to. We assume, very conservatively, that (almost) any instruction might
raise an exception and always check for equivalence along the exceptional
control flow path from the instruction as well as the normal one(s).

(A side-effect of this refinement is that the same code can be analyzed more
than once, with different handler stacks, which adds precision.)

Unset Variables
===============

The initial assertion we used on entry points above was "true", which means that
the stacks, heaps and named locals are equal, but says nothing at all about the
unnamed locals. In fact, the unnamed locals will be "unset" at the start, and
code sometimes tests if locals are set. If we started with "true" and then
executed Isset _l in both programs, we wouldn't know that the two tests would
evaluate the same way. So we further refine assertions to track two sets of
variables (one for each side) that are *not* known to be unset - all others are
known to be unset. So our initial assertion becomes (true,{},{}). When variables
are assigned, they are added to the relevant sets as well as having equalities
recorded; explicit Unsets remove variables from the sets, and we have a refined
notion of entailment between assertions:

 (phi2,vs2,vs2') => (phi1,vs1,vs1')
 if
 forall (v,v') in phi1, (v,v') \in phi2 | not (v in vs2 | v' in vs2')
 & vs2 subset vs1
 & vs2' subset vs1'


Class Loading and Matching
==========================

How do we decide which classes to compare from the two programs? One could do
this by name, but the compilers can generate differently-named classes to
implement closures. Furthermore, it's possible to have more than one class with
the same name appearing in an hhas file - nested classes can be loaded
dynamically. Semdiff initially analyzes top-level functions, including ".main".
When a pair of DefCls or CreateCl instructions are reached on the two sides, the
classes to which they refer (by number, not name) are scheduled for comparison.

This seems to be the best we can do on the basis of the information that's
actually in the hhas file, though it seems that hhvm does actually load some
classes for which a corresponding DefCls instruction is never executed. It also
requires hack to produce the DefCls instructions in the same order as hhvm does.

Function Loading
================

We schedule top-level functions for comparison eagerly, by name. But functions
that are marked [nontop] in the input are dynamically scheduled for comparison
when corresponding pairs of DefFunc instructions are encountered, much like the
dynamic class loading described above.

Other Remarks
=============

Conjunction
-----------

The reader may have noticed that we said there was a *set* of pc,pc':[phi]
judgements, rather than a simple map from pc,pc' pairs to assertions. This is
deliberate: a single pair of program counters can be associated with more than
one assertion. This represents a conjunction of judegements, or a disjunction of
assertions:

(pc,pc' : [phi1]) /\ (pc,pc' : [phi2])  <=>  pc,pc' : [phi1 \/ phi2]

the analysis actually loops round when it gets back to a pc,pc' pair it's
visited before, trying to find a fixpoint and potentially analyzing the same
code several times under different assumptions. In reality, we quit if we don't
find a fixed point after two iterations, as that seems to work well enough in
practice. Nevertheless, the extra power compared to a non-iterative/conjunctive
analysis is useful, particularly for exception handlers which (thanks to our
conservative approach to where exceptions might be thrown) can be jumped to from
many places, in which different assertions may hold.

Interpreting the result of the tool
-----------------------------------

Semdiff produces several kinds of output, and which ones are shown depends on
the verbosity setting.

If it's run with --verbose 0, then it simply produces a single number on stdout.
This is a percentage similarity measure: 100.00 means that the two input files
are semantically equivalent. Anything less means that some (potential) semantic
difference was found. In that case, the number is a *rough* measure of the
*syntactic* edit distance between the two programs. (Unfortunately, we do not
have a good notion of semantic edit distance.)

If it's run with --verbose 1, then semdiff reports the syntactic edit distance,
the size of the input, the similarity percentage and a (possibly empty) list of
syntactic edits, in a diff-like format. Note that the syntactic diff is
typically rather larger than the minimal change that would be required to make
the two programs equivalent, so shouldn't be read as the *reason* why the
attempt to prove equivalence failed.

If it's run with --verbose 2, then the tool also produces logging information,
reporting on what it's compared, which special rules have fired, and its
internal state in the case that it is unable to prove equivalence. In the case
that comparison of two methods or functions fails, the logging output will look
something like this:

comparing key test
create cl pattern at lines 10, 10
Semdiff failed
pc=;15, pc'=;15, i=CreateCl 0 7 i'=CUGetL $w asn={}{}
Assumed=
[;0,;0-><{}{}>]
[;1,;1-><{}{}>]
[;2,;2-><{}{}>]
[;3,;3-><{}{}>]
[;4,;4-><{}{}>]
[;5,;5-><{}{}>]
[;6,;6-><{}{}>]
[;10,;10-><{}{}>]
[;11,;11-><{}{}>]
[;12,;12-><{}{}>]
[;13,;13-><{}{}>]
[;14,;14-><{}{}>]

Todo=

This shows that in the function "test", semdiff failed when it reached
instruction number 15 on both sides. The left-hand program had a CreateCl
instruction, whereas the right-hand one had a CUGetL instruction. The assertion
that was active at that point ("asn=") was just (True,{},{}). "Assumed" shows
the list of pc,pc' |- [asn] judgements that have already been visited in the
proof search, which in this case are rather uninteresting. Todo is the (here
empty) list of pending judgements. The crucial thing to focus on is the pair of
instructions that led to the failure, and the assertion that we were trying to
prove there. The assumed and todo sets give some indication of the path that
semdiff was exploring when it got stuck, but can be non-trivial to decipher  :-(

In more complex cases, the pc's will also include a stack of handlers (innermost
first), represented by the index of the corresponding handler code.
