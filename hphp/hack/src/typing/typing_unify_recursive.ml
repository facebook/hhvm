(* Wrapped version of Env.add that deals with the possibility of
 * the variable [x] occurring in type [ty], taking three possible
 * courses of action:
 *   1. If [x] does not occur in [ty] then the assignment x:=ty is
        added to the substitution by calling Env.add
 *   2. If [x] does occur in [ty] but it is possible to compute
        a substitution that unifies [x] with [ty] then do so.
 *   3. Otherwise log an "circular type" error
 * Note that as a consequence, cycles in types are never created through
 * unification and so there is no need to maintain lists of "seen"
 * variables in functions that recurse over type structure.
