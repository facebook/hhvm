(**
 * This is a simple data structure that allows querying for the docblock
 * given a line in the source code. Rough description:
 *
 * 1. Find the last comment preceding the line of the definition.
 *    We also make sure this doesn't overlap with the preceding definition.
 *    If the last comment is more than 1 line away, it is ignored.
 *
 * 2. If the last comment is a block-style comment (/* */) just return it.
 *
 * 3. Otherwise (if it is a line style comment //) attempt to merge it with
 *    preceding line comments, if they exist.
 *      NOTE: We also enforce that line comments must be on the definition's
 *            immediately preceding line.
