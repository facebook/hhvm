error: Typing[4110] Invalid return type

File class_constant.php, line 9, character 10 - line 9, character 11:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(): int {
 8 |   $x = C::FOO;
 9 |   return »$x«;
10 | }

Expected int

File class_constant.php, line 7, character 17 - line 7, character 19:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(): »int« {
 8 |   $x = C::FOO;
 9 |   return $x;
10 | }

But got string

File class_constant.php, line 4, character 9 - line 4, character 14:

 3 | class C {
 4 |   const »string« FOO = "foo";
 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(): int {

Here's why:


  Step 1 of 1                                 (here is where the error occurred) 

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint

File class_constant.php, line 4, character 9 - line 4, character 14:

 3 | class C {
 4 |   const »string« FOO = "foo";
 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(): int {

which is defined here

File string.hhi, line 6, character 15 - line 6, character 20:

 5 |   <<__SupportDynamicType>>
 6 |   final class »string« {
 7 |     // All methods are ignored unless ignore_string_methods is set to false in .hhconfig
 8 |     <<__ImplementedBy('\HH\String\__primitive_length')>>
 9 |     public function length(): int;

and flows into this class constant access expression

File class_constant.php, line 8, character 8 - line 8, character 13:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(): int {
 8 |   $x = »C::FOO«;
 9 |   return $x;
10 | }

as the type of the constant

which itself flows into this expression

File class_constant.php, line 8, character 3 - line 8, character 4:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(): int {
 8 |   »$x« = C::FOO;
 9 |   return $x;
10 | }

via an assignment

which itself flows into this expression

File class_constant.php, line 9, character 10 - line 9, character 11:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(): int {
 8 |   $x = C::FOO;
 9 |   return »$x«;
10 | }

as the type of the local variable

which itself flows into this expression

File class_constant.php, line 9, character 3 - line 9, character 12:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(): int {
 8 |   $x = C::FOO;
 9 |   »return $x;«
10 | }

because it is used in a return position

The supertype comes from this hint

File class_constant.php, line 7, character 17 - line 7, character 19:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function bar(): »int« {
 8 |   $x = C::FOO;
 9 |   return $x;
10 | }
