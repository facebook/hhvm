/*
 * Try to get a Unit* for a php file, given a path and directory.  The actual
 * path to try to find the file at is located using these arguments,
 * resolveVmInclude, and possibly StatCache::realpath calls.
 *
 * In RepoAuthoritative mode, this will only find Units that were compiled into
 * the repo ahead of time.  Otherwise, this function may invoke the compiler to
 * create a new Unit for a file.  Units are cached across requests in either
 * case, so even in non-RepoAuthoritative mode this function won't need to
 * compile it over and over, but it does need to check whether the file has
 * changed.
 *
 * The `initial_opt' argument performs two functions, if non-null:
 *
 *    o It is an output param indicating whether whether this was the first
 *      time this unit was found in this request.  (For example, if you are
 *      doing an include_once you need to know whether it was already
 *      included.)
 *
 *    o It means we should count this lookup as a request-local lookup for the
 *      current request.
 *
 * May return nullptr if the Unit can't be loaded, and may throw exceptions or
 * fatal errors.
