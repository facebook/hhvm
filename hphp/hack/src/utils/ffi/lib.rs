//! There are basically two kinds of types can't be made `repr(C)`:
//!   * builtin types making no guaratees about binary layout (e.g.
//!     wide pointers, tuples)
//!   * type with definitions that are beyond our reach to annotate
//!     with `repr(C)` (e.g. standard or vendored types).
//!
//! The types in this crate are C friendly substitutions for a
//! handful of these types.
