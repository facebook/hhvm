define: DUK_OPT_NONSTD_FUNC_CALLER_PROPERTY
introduced: 1.0.0
tags:
  - ecmascript
description: >
  Add a non-standard "caller" property to non-strict function instances
  for better compatibility with existing code.  The semantics of this
  property are not standardized and may vary between engines; Duktape tries
  to behave close to V8 and Spidermonkey.  See
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/caller
  description of the property.  This feature disables tail call support.

  This feature conflicts with several other features, so you should use it
  only if it's absolutely necessary.
