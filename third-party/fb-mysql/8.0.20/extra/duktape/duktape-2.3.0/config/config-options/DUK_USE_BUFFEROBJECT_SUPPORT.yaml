  Enable support for Khronos/ES6 typed arrays and Node.js Buffer objects.

  When disabled, Duktape custom plain buffer type is present and functional
  in the C API.  Plain buffers have virtual properties and you can read/write
  buffer contents in Ecmascript code.  Plain buffers will still inherit from
  ArrayBuffer.prototype, but none of the Ecmascript buffer related bindings
  will work.  This includes all ArrayBuffer, typed array, and Node.js Buffer
  methods.  Native bindings which produce plain buffer results (like
  Duktape.dec()) will still work.
