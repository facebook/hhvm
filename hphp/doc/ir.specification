* HipHop Intermediate Representation (HHIR)
*******************************************



Introduction
------------

The HipHop Intermediate Representation (IR) is a typed, in-memory,
static-single-assignment, intermediate-level representation of HHBC programs
used for just in time compilation, with these goals:

  1. Complete. The IR represents a program or program fragment entirely,
     without reference to HHBC or other upstream forms of the program.

  2. Type-Safe. Since the IR deals directly with refined types and internal VM
     types, all operations are typesafe. All instruction parameters have a
     parameter type P, and all variables have a type S. Given an instruction
     with source parameter type P and variable type S, S must be equal to or
     more refined than P (S == P or S <: P).

  3. Machine Independent. Since this IR is intended to be used in a JIT
     compiler, it will always be used in a machine specific context.
     Nevertheless, we rely on machine independence in order to separate
     concerns and increase portability of the VM. Passes which manipulate IR
     based on PHP or HHBC semantics should be portable. Passes which deal with
     machine specifics (such as register allocation) should be self contained.
     For example, register allocation may insert machine-specific loads,
     stores, or swaps, according to a specific cpu model. But those
     instructions are still well behaved Instruction classes. Types are machine
     independent.

The unit of compilation is the Trace, which is a sequence of Blocks of
Instructions that produce and consume Variables. Blocks are single-entry,
single-exit sequences of instructions (i.e. basic blocks). Instructions may be
annotated with Type which modifies the instruction's behavior. Each Variable
has a Type which describes the set of values it may hold at the point it is
defined. Instructions may have side effects, which occur in execution order.

The static single assignment form guarantees the following two invariants for a
well-formed Trace:

  1. Each Variable is assigned to by exactly one Instruction.

  2. Definitions dominate uses. Every path to an Instruction using a Variable
     first executes the Instruction defining the Variable.

Any pass that generates or manipulates IR must preserve these invariants,
however it is possible and expected for the invariants to be temporarily broken
during trace creation or during an optimizer pass.


Control Flow
------------

Traces have one entry block and zero or more exit traces. Blocks may branch
within a trace or to an exit trace; blocks form a restricted control flow
graph. This control flow may contain join points (two or more branches exiting
at the same point, or two jumps within the trace to a target in the same
trace), but may not form loops.

No Variables are defined on entry to the main Trace.

Blocks which are join points may start with a DefLabel with destination
Variables. In that case, each predecessor must be a Jmp passing a matching
number of source Variables. In this case the Jmp acts as a tail-call, passing
arguments the same way a plain call would.

Together, the sources of the Jmp instructions and the destinations of the
DefLabel instructions act as traditional SSA Phi pseudo-functions; The type of
the label's destination is the type-union of the corresponding sources.
Because the Jmp sources are at the ends of blocks, they do not violate the SSA
dominator rule (rule 2, above).

Implementation note: The JIT's compilation unit ("Trace" in this spec) actually
consists of one or more instances of the Trace class. There is exactly one main
trace, and zero or more exit traces which handle side exits. Instructions in
exit traces may use Variables defined on the main trace, so these exits are not
separate compilation units.

Types
-----

For an overview of the HHIR type system, see the "Type System" section in
hackers-guide/jit-core.md.

Variables
---------

A Variable represents a storage location which takes on various concrete values
at runtime. Since HHIR uses SSA, a variable may only be assigned to by one
instruction. A variable's type represents the set of values it may hold at the
point it is defined. The type is invariant over the lifetime of the variable
(from the definition point to the last use).

Implementation note: this the proposed semantics. The current implementation is
not this strict; during IR generation, we overload instruction type
(IRInstruction::m_type), variable type (SSATmp::getType returns instr->type),
and types known at points *after* definition, due to guards. E.g. after a
guard, we change src->instr->type to the refined type, then propagate this
backwards through copies. This effectively uses IRInstruction::m_type as a
scratch variable, which is only valid at certain times during construction).
This is probably unsound in later passes; after such a refinement, instructions
using the variable before the guard see the refined type.


Instructions
------------

An instruction is an executable operation with zero or more inputs (sources),
zero or one result (destination), and possible side effects such as accessing
memory, doing I/O, and which may branch or throw an exception. Some
instructions have a Type parameter which modifies its behavior.

Each instruction has a signature which describes its effect, parameter types,
and return type, for example:

  r:Bool = IsType<T> s:Gen

By convention we use infix; destinations on the left, = represents assignment,
then the opcode name, and source parameters. Types are to the right of the
entities they modify, separated by : for results, sources, and variables, or
delimited by <> for instruction modifiers.

Instruction flags further describe their behavior:

HasDest
NaryDest

  The instruction defines exactly one destination variable (HasDest) or a
  varying number of destination variables (NaryDest). These flags are mutually
  exclusive. An instruction with neither of these flags set has zero
  destination variables.

  Note that an instruction's destination variable may sometimes be a copy of
  one of the input variables. (For example, AddElem returns the array it took
  as an input.)

CanCSE

  The instruction is safe to elide through common subexpression elimination.

Essential

  Whether the instruction is essential indicates whether it can be elided
  through certain types of optimizations.

  Currently this is just used to flag whether we are allowed to do dead code
  elimination on it.

CallsNative

  Indicates that the instruction will call a native helper.

  The register allocator uses this to optimize register spills around native
  calls and to bias register allocation toward arguments and return values.

ConsumesRC

  The instruction consumes a reference to one or more of its sources, either by
  decreasing its refcount or storing the reference to memory.

KillsSource

  The instruction calls decref on one or more of its sources. Unless a source
  is known to have a refcount > 1 before the instruction executes, it cannot
  safely be used after the instruction has executed.

ProducesRC

  The instruction produces an incref'd value.

  This flag is currently unused.

MayRaiseError

  The instruction may raise an error, and therefore has an implicit exit edge.

Terminal

  The instruction has no next instruction; it either jumps, returns, or throws.

Branch

  The instruction has a (sometimes optional) taken edge. Instructions that are
  conditional branches (i.e. a Branch that is not Terminal) will also have a
  next edge.

Passthrough

  The value of the instruction's dest is the same as one of its inputs; it
  differs only in the refcount of the underlying object, the type of the
  variable, or some other property that doesn't affect the value of the
  variable itself.

ModifiesStack

  The instruction modifies the in-memory evaluation stack in the process of
  performing its primary work. It will have a StkPtr destination in addition to
  its primary destination.

HasStackVersion

  This instruction has a counterpart that returns a StkPtr in addition to any
  primary destination. The behavior of the stack-modifying version is otherwise
  identical.

MInstrProp

  The instruction may affect the type and/or value of its base operand,
  operating on object properties.

MInstrElem

  The instruction may affect the type and/or value of its base operand,
  operating on array elements.

Instruction set
---------------

1. Checks and Asserts

Note: Instructions that guard or check boxed types only check that the operand
is boxed, and they ignore the type of the value inside the box (the inner
type). The inner type is normally checked when the value within the box is
loaded by a LdRef instruction (which takes box/ref values, and only checks the
inner type). The reasoning for this approach is that boxed values may alias.
Therefore, in lack of memory alias analysis, the inner types generally need to
be rechecked before each use.

D:T = CheckType<T> S0:Gen -> B

  Check that the type of the src S0 is T, and if so copy it to D. If S0 is not
  type T, branch to block B.

CheckNullptr S0:{CountedStr|NullPtr} -> B

  If S0 is a null pointer, branch to block B. This is used to check the return
  value of a native helper that returns a potentially null StringData*.

D:T = AssertType<T> S0:{Gen|Nullptr}

  Assert that the type of S0 is T, copying it to D.

CheckTypeMem<T> S0:PtrToGen -> B

  If the value pointed to by S0 is not type T, branch to the block B.

D:FramePtr = GuardLoc<T,localId> S0:FramePtr

  Guard that type of the given localId on the frame S0 is a subtype of the type
  T; if not, make a fallback jump. (A jump to a service request that chains to
  a retranslation for this tracelet.)

  Returns a new frame pointer representing the same frame as S0 but with the
  knowledge that the guarded local has type T.

D:FramePtr = CheckLoc<T,localId> S0:FramePtr -> B

  Check that type of the given localId on the frame S0 is T; if not, branch to
  block B.

  Returns a new frame pointer representing the same frame as S0 but with the
  knowledge that the checked local has type T.

D:FramePtr = AssertLoc<T,localId> S0:FramePtr

  Asserts that type of the supplied local on the frame S0 is T. This is used as
  a hint for local type information, and is similar to GuardLoc except it
  doesn't imply a runtime check and cannot cause control flow.

  Returns a new frame pointer representing the same frame as S0 but with the
  knowledge that the asserted local has type T.

D:StkPtr = GuardStk<T,offset> S0:StkPtr

  Guard that the type of the cell on the stack pointed to by S0 at offset (in
  cells) is T. If not, make a fallback jump. (A jump to a service request that
  chains to a retranslation for this tracelet.)

  Returns a new StkPtr that represents the same stack but with the knowledge
  that the slot at the index S1 has type T.

D:StkPtr = CheckStk<T,offset> S0:StkPtr -> B

  Check that the type of the cell on the stack pointed to by S0 at offset (in
  cells) is T; if not, branch to block B.

  Returns a new StkPtr that represents the same stack but with the knowledge
  that the slot at the index S1 has type T.

D:StkPtr = AssertStk<T,offset> S0:StkPtr

  Returns a new StkPtr that represents the same stack as S0, but with the
  knowledge that the slot at offset (in cells) has type T. This is similar to a
  GuardStk except that it does not imply a runtime check and cannot cause
  control flow.

D:StkPtr = CastStk<T,offset> S0:StkPtr

  Returns a new StkPtr that represents the same stack as S0, but with the slot
  at offset (in cells) converted to type T.

D:StkPtr = CastStkIntToDbl<offset> S0:StkPtr

  Returns a new StkPtr where the slot at offset has been converted from an
  integer to double.

D:StkPtr = CoerceStk<T,offset> S0:StkPtr -> B

  Returns a new StkPtr that represents the same stack as S0, but with the slot
  at offset (in cells) converted to type T. If the type conversion can't be
  done then branches to block B.

CheckInit S0:Gen -> B

  If S0's type is Uninit, branch to block B.

CheckInitMem S0:PtrToGen S1:ConstInt -> B

  If the value at S0 + S1 (in bytes) has type Uninit, branch to block B.

CheckDefinedClsEq<className,classPtr> -> B

  Compare the currently defined class of name `className' with `classPtr'; if
  they aren't equal or if `className' is not defined, branch to block B.

CheckCold<TransID> -> B

  Check if the counter associated with translation TransID is cold (i.e. within
  a fixed threshold). If it's not (i.e. such translation has reached the
  "hotness threshold"), then branch to block B.

GuardRefs S0:Func S1:Int S2:Int S3:Int S4:Int S5:Int

  Perform reffiness guard checks. Operands:

    S0 - function pointer for the frame
    S1 - num params expected in the func
    S2 - first bit to check, must be a multiple of 64
    S3 - mask to check (RefDeps::Record::m_mask entires)
    S4 - values to check (RefDeps::Record::m_vals entires)

  If any of the checks fail, make a fallback jump. (Jump to a service request
  that will chain to a retranslation of this tracelet.)

CheckRefs S0:Func S1:Int S2:Int S3:Int S4:Int S5:Int -> B

  Perform reffiness guard checks. Operands:

    S0 - function pointer for the frame
    S1 - num params expected in the func
    S2 - first bit to check, must be a multiple of 64
    S3 - mask to check (RefDeps::Record::m_mask entires)
    S4 - values to check (RefDeps::Record::m_vals entires)

  If any of the checks fail, branch to block B.

EndGuards

  A no-op at runtime, this instruction serves to mark the end of the initial
  sequence of guards in a trace.

D:{Func} = CheckNonNull S0:{Nullptr|Func|PtrToGen|TCA} -> B

  If the value in S0 is Nullptr, branch to block B.

D:{CountedStr|Func} = AssertNonNull S0:{Nullptr|CountedStr|Func}

  Returns S0, with Nullptr removed from its type. This instruction currently
  supports a very limited range of types but can be expanded if needed.

CheckStaticLocInit S0:BoxedCell -> B

  Check if the static local (RDS) RefData represented by S0 is initialized, and
  if not branch to block B.


2. Arithmetic


D:Dbl     = AbsDbl S0:Dbl
D:Int     = AddInt S0:Int S1:Int
D:Int     = SubInt S0:Int S1:Int
D:Int     = MulInt S0:Int S1:Int
D:Dbl     = AddDbl S0:Dbl S1:Dbl
D:Dbl     = SubDbl S0:Dbl S1:Dbl
D:Dbl     = MulDbl S0:Dbl S1:Dbl
D:Int     = Mod    S0:Int S1:Int
D:Dbl     = Sqrt   S0:Dbl
D:Dbl     = DivDbl S0:Dbl S1:Dbl -> B
D:Int     = AndInt S0:Int S1:Int
D:Int     = OrInt  S0:Int S1:Int
D:Int     = XorInt S0:Int S1:Int
D:Int     = Shl    S0:Int S1:Int
D:Int     = Shr    S0:Int S1:Int
D:Dbl     = Floor  S0:Dbl
D:Dbl     = Ceil   S0:Dbl
D:Int     = AddIntO S0:Int S1:Int -> B
D:Int     = SubIntO S0:Int S1:Int -> B
D:Int     = MulIntO S0:Int S1:Int -> B

  Double arithmetic, integer arithmetic, and integer bitwise operations.
  Performs the operation described by the opcode name on S0 and S1, and puts
  the result in D.

  Undefined behavior occurs if Mod is given a divisor of zero, or if the
  divisor is -1 and the dividend is the minimum representable integer.

  AbsDbl computes the absolute value of a double-precision value by clearing
  the sign bit.

  DivDbl will branch to block B when S1 is zero (signed or unsigned). When the
  result of the division is a real valued number DivDbl conforms to IEEE 754.
  In particular should the result of a division be zero the sign will follow
  normal sign rules for division.

  Note that Shr is an arithmetic right shift: The MSB is sign-extended.

  Floor and Ceil will return an integral value not greater, or not less
  than their input respectively. Their use requires SSE 4.1, availability
  should be checked before they are emitted.

  AddIntO, SubIntO, MulIntO perform integer arithmetic on S0 and S1, but will
  branch to block B on integer overflow.

D:Bool = XorBool S0:Bool S1:Bool

  Logical XOR of the two sources. (Note that && and || do not have
  corresponding opcodes because they're handled at the bytecode level, to
  implement short-circuiting.)


3. Type conversions

D:Str  = ConvObjToStr S0:Obj
D:Str  = ConvCellToStr S0:Cell

  Convert S0 from its current type to the destination type, according to the
  PHP semantics of such a conversion.

D:Cctx = ConvClsToCctx S0:Cls

  Convert a class to a class context (i.e. the class with a 1 or'd into the low
  bit).

4. Boolean predicates


D:Bool = Gt    S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = GtX   S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = Gte   S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = GteX  S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = Lt    S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = LtX   S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = Lte   S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = LteX  S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = Eq    S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = EqX   S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = Neq   S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = NeqX  S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = Same  S0:Gen S1:Gen
D:Bool = NSame S0:Gen S1:Gen

  Perform comparisons with PHP semantics on S0 and S1, and put the result in D.
  The -X versions may re-enter the VM when comparing an Object with a string,
  and therefore may throw exceptions. The non-X versions must not be passed
  (Object,String) pairs, and do not throw. Note that Same and NSame never
  re-enter or throw, for any types.

D:Bool = GtInt   S0:Int S1:Int
D:Bool = GteInt  S0:Int S1:Int
D:Bool = LtInt   S0:Int S1:Int
D:Bool = LteInt  S0:Int S1:Int
D:Bool = EqInt   S0:Int S1:Int
D:Bool = NeqInt  S0:Int S1:Int

  Perform 64-bit integer comparisons.

D:Bool = GtDbl   S0:Dbl S1:Dbl
D:Bool = GteDbl  S0:Dbl S1:Dbl
D:Bool = LtDbl   S0:Dbl S1:Dbl
D:Bool = LteDbl  S0:Dbl S1:Dbl
D:Bool = EqDbl   S0:Dbl S1:Dbl
D:Bool = NeqDbl  S0:Dbl S1:Dbl

  Perform comparisons of doubles. Comparisons that are unordered according to
  IEEE 754 (such as when at least one operand is NaN) result in false.

D:Bool = InstanceOf S0:Cls S1:{Cls|Nullptr}

  Sets D based on whether S0 is a descendant of the class, interface, or trait
  in S1. (Note that this is always false for a trait). S1 may be null at
  runtime if the class is not defined.

D:Bool = InstanceOfIface S0:Cls S1:Cls

  Fast path for interface checks. Sets D based on whether S0 implements S1, but
  S1 must be a unique interface. This should only be used in repo-authoritative
  mode.

D:Bool = ExtendsClass S0:Cls S1:Cls

  A fast-path for instanceof checks. Sets D based on whether S0 is a descendant
  of the class in S1, where S1 must be a unique class that is not an interface
  or a trait.

D:Bool =  InstanceOfBitmask S0:Cls S1:ConstStr
D:Bool = NInstanceOfBitmask S0:Cls S1:ConstStr

  A fast-path for instanceof checks. Sets D based on whether S0 is a descendant
  of the class named by S1, where S1 must have a bit allocated for it in the
  fast instance check bitvector (see class.h).

D:Bool = InterfaceSupportsArr S0:Str
D:Bool = InterfaceSupportsStr S0:Str
D:Bool = InterfaceSupportsInt S0:Str
D:Bool = InterfaceSupportsDbl S0:Str

  Returns whether t instanceof S0 returns true when t is of the given type.

D:Bool =  IsType<T> S0:Cell
D:Bool = IsNType<T> S0:Cell

  IsType (IsNType) sets D to true iff S0 holds a value that is (not) of type T.

D:Bool =  IsTypeMem<T> S0:PtrToGen
D:Bool = IsNTypeMem<T> S0:PtrToGen

  IsTypeMem (IsNTypeMem) sets D to true iff the value referenced by S0 is (not)
  of type T.

D:Bool = IsScalarType S0:Cell

  Returns true if S0 is of type Int, Bool, Dbl or Str. Returns false otherwise.

D:Bool = IsWaitHandle S0:Obj

  Sets D to true iff S0 is a subclass of WaitHandle.


5. Branches


There is a conditional branch instruction for each predicate above, to enable
generating efficient compare-and-branch instruction sequences.

JmpGt   JmpGtInt
JmpGte  JmpGteInt
JmpLt   JmpLtInt
JmpLte  JmpLteInt
JmpEq   JmpEqInt
JmpNeq  JmpNeqInt
JmpSame
JmpNSame
JmpInstanceOf
JmpInstanceOfBitmask
JmpNInstanceOfBitmask

  Fused jump instructions. These all operate exactly as their corresponding
  query op, but also take a label to jump to when the condition is true.

JmpZero S0:{Bool|Int} L:Label
JmpNZero S0:{Bool|Int} L:Label

  Conditionally jump to L based on S0.

JmpSwitchDest<JmpSwitchData> S0:Int

  Jump to the target of a switch statement using table metadata <JmpSwitchData>
  and index S0.

CheckSurpriseFlags -> B

  Tests the implementation-specific surprise flags. If they're true, branches
  to block B.

SurpriseHook

  Executes the implementation-specific surprise flag hook.

FunctionExitSurpriseHook S0:FramePtr S1:Gen

  Executes the implementation-specific surprise flag hook for function exit. S0
  should be the current frame pointer, and S1 should be the return value
  of the function.

Halt

  Halt execution. Used only in tests, as a terminal instruction that does not
  require any inputs or any successors.

Jmp -> B
Jmp [S:T ...] -> B: DefLabel

  Unconditional jump to block B. In the second form, the target block must
  start with a DefLabel with the same number of destinations as Jmp's number of
  sources. Jmp parallel-copies its sources to the DefLabel destinations.

DefLabel
D:T ... = DefLabel

  DefLabel defines variables received from a previous Jmp. A DefLabel with zero
  destinations is a no-op, and the predecessor blocks may not necessarily end
  in Jmp. A DefLabel with one or more destinations may only be reached by a Jmp
  instruction with the same number of sources. Ordinary branch instructions may
  not pass values to a DefLabel.


6. Reference manipulation


D:Cell = Unbox S0:Gen

  Unbox S0 if it is boxed, and put the resulting Cell in D.

D:BoxedCell = Box S0:Gen

  Box S0 if it is unboxed, and put the resulting BoxedCell in D.

D:PtrToCell = UnboxPtr S0:PtrToGen

  If S0 points to a cell that is KindOfRef, dereference the pointer in the
  TypedValue and return a pointer to the inner-cell in D.

D:PtrToBoxedCell = BoxPtr S0:PtrToGen

  Boxes the TypeValue that S0 points to if it is not boxed. The result D points
  to the same TypedValue as S0 but has a more refined type.


7. Loads


Some of the load instructions have an optional label parameter that make the
load also perform a runtime type check. A load that has a label parameter
present checks that the value it loads has the type T, where T is load
instruction's type parameter, and branches to its label if the type check
fails.

LdLoc and LdStack have corresponding GuardLoc and GuardStk instructions that
allow the compiler to decouple type checks from the load operation. The type
guards for locals and stacks are generated eagerly at the start of a tracelet,
while other guards (typically generated due to type prediction) are generated
at the point where the guarded value is loaded. Allowing the checks for locals
and stack to be decoupled gives the compiler the flexibility to avoid partially
dead loads of local and stack values and to avoid unnecessarily long live
ranges due to eagerly loaded values at the start of the tracelet.

D:T = LdStack<T,offset> S0:StkPtr

  Loads from S0 at offset (in cells), and puts the value in D as type T.

TakeStack S0:Gen

  Does nothing at runtime. Acts as a hint to the optimizer that the code is
  taking ownership of a reference to S0.

D:T = LdLoc<T,localId> S0:FramePtr

  Loads local slot localId from the frame S0 and puts the value in D as type T.

D:T = LdGbl<T,localId> S0:FramePtr -> B

  Loads local number localId from frame S0 and puts the value in D if the
  local's type is a subtype of T. If the local's type is not a subtype of T,
  then the load does not happen, and this instruction branches to B.

D:PtrToGen = LdStackAddr<offset> S0:StkPtr

  Loads the address of the stack slot given by the pointer in S0 at the offset
  (in cells).

D:T* = LdLocAddr<T,localId> S0:FramePtr

  Loads the address of the local slot localId from the frame S0 into D.

D:PtrToCell = LdVectorBase S0:Obj<Vector>
D:PtrToCell = LdPairBase S0:Obj<Pair>

  Loads the base pointer to an array of Cells from the given collection
  instance in S0.

D:T = LdMem<T> S0:PtrToGen S1:ConstInt [ -> B ]

  Loads from S0 + S1 (in bytes) and puts the value in D. If the optional target
  block B is specified and the loaded value's type does not match T, this
  instruction does not load into D and branches to block B.

D:T = LdProp<T> S0:Obj S1:ConstInt [ -> B ]

  Loads a property from the object referenced by S0 at the offset given by S1
  and puts the value in D. If the optional target B is specified and the loaded
  value's type does not match T, this instruction does not load into D and
  branches to block B.

D:Cell = LdElem S0:PtrToCell S1:Int

  Loads the element at index S1 from the base pointer in S0. The index in S1 is
  the number of bytes from the base in S0.

D:T = LdRef<T> S0:Cell& [ -> B ]

  Loads the value held in the box referenced by S0 and puts the value in D. If
  the optional target B is specified and the loaded value's type does not match
  T, this instruction does not load into D and branches to block B.

D:Obj = LdThis S0:FramePtr [ -> B ]

  Loads the this pointer out of the ActRec pointed to by S0, and puts it in D.
  If the optional block B is supplied, if the this pointer in S0 is null, this
  instruction does not load it into D and branches to block B.

D:Ctx = LdCtx<func> S0:FramePtr

  Loads into D the value of the m_this/m_cls field out of the frame pointer S0,
  which must be a frame of the function in the function parameter. The result
  could be either an object representing the this pointer or a class context.

D:Cctx = LdCctx S0:FramePtr

  Loads into D the value of the m_cls field out of the frame pointer S0. The
  compiler should generate this only if it can prove that the frame does not
  contain a $this pointer.

D:Cls = LdClsCtx S0:Ctx

  Loads into D the class representing the current context. Extracts the class
  from the S0, which can be either the this pointer or the context class.

D:Cls = LdClsCctx S0:Cctx

  Loads into D the class representing the current context. Extracts the class
  from the S0, which is a context class.

D:Func = LdClsCtor S0:Cls

  Loads into D the constructor of class S0. If the constructor cannot be called
  from the current context, raise an error.

D:ConstT = DefConst<T>

  Define a constant value of type T. D is presumed to be globally available and
  the DefConst instruction will not actually appear in the IR instruction
  stream.

D:T = Conjure<T>

  Define a value of type T. This instruction aborts at runtime; it is meant to
  be used in tests or code that is known to be unreachable.

D:Cls = LdCls S0:Str S1:ConstCls

  Loads the class named S0 in the context of the class S1. Invokes autoload and
  may raise an error if the class is not defined. The explicit context
  parameter allows the compiler to simplify this instruction to a DefConst in
  some cases. If S0 is constant, this instruction may be simplified to a
  LdClsCached.

D:Cls = LdClsCached S0:ConstStr

  Loads the class named S0 via the RDS. Invokes autoload and may raise an error
  if the class is not defined.

D:Cls = LdClsCachedSafe S0:ConstStr [ -> B ]

  Loads the class whose name is S0 out of the RDS. If the class is not defined,
  returns null and optionally branches to block B.

D:T = LdClsCns<T,className,constName> [ -> B ]

  Loads the named class constant for a class via the RDS. This instruction
  should generally be followed by CheckInit, unless we know the class is
  already loaded.

  If the optional block B is specified and the loaded value's type does not
  match T, this instruction does not load into D and branches to block B.

  The result may be uninitialized if the class is not defined. Note that no
  decref of the result is necessary because class constants will always be
  static.

D:PtrToCell = LdClsInitData S0:Cls

  Loads the pointer to the property initializer array for class S0.

D:RDSHandle = LookupClsRDSHandle S0:Str

  Look up the cached-class RDS handle for a given class name.

D:{Cls|nullptr} = DerefClsRDSHandle S0:RDSHandle

  Dereference an RDS handle that points to a cached class slot.

D:T = LookupCns<T,constName>
D:T = LookupCnsE<T,constName>

  Load a constant via the RDS. Raises an undefined constant notice if the
  constant cannot be defined. The E variant will instead throw a fatal error if
  it cannot define the constant.

D:T = LookupCnsU<T,constName,fallbackName>

  Load an unqualified constant via the RDS, first by trying constName, then by
  trying fallbackName. Raises a notice if neither can be found.

D:T = LookupClsCns<T,className,constName>

  Load a class constant for a class via the RDS, invoking autoload if it is not
  defined. This instruction may raise an undefined constant error if autoload
  cannot define the constant.

D:{Func|Nullptr} = LdClsMethodFCacheFunc<clsName, methodName>

  Loads the target cache entry for a forwarding call to clsName::methodName.
  May be Nullptr, if the method does not exist or the cache hasn't been filled
  yet.

D:{Func|Nullptr} =
LookupClsMethodFCache<clsName, methodName> S0:ConstCls S1:FramePtr

  Lookup clsName::methodName in the forwarding class method cache. S0 should be
  the Class named by clsName and S1 should be the current vm frame pointer. May
  return Nullptr if lookup fails using a subset of the required lookup paths,
  indicating that a more complete lookup path should be taken. May throw if the
  method does not exist.

D:Ctx = GetCtxFwdCallDyn<clsName, methodName> S0:Ctx

  If S0 is a Cctx, return S0. If S0 is an object, check if clsName::methodName
  is a static method. If it is, return S0's class as a Ctx pointer. If not,
  return S0. If S0 is a Ctx, dynamically check if it is an object or Cctx at
  runtime and perform the operations described above.

D:Ctx = GetCtxFwdCall S0:Ctx S1:Func

  If S0 is an object and S1 is static, this opcode returns S0's class. If S0 is
  an object and S1 is not static, this opcode increfs S0 and returns it. If S0
  is a Cctx, this opcode returns S0.

D:{Func|Nullptr} = LdClsMethodCacheFunc<clsName, methodName>

  Loads the target cache entry for the method clsName::methodName. The result
  may be Nullptr, if the method does not exist or the cache hasn't been filled
  yet.

D:Cctx = LdClsMethodCacheCls<clsName, methodName>

  Loads the target cache class context entry for a call to clsName::methodName
  from the current context. This instruction must only be used when the value
  is known to not be empty.

D:{Func|Nullptr} =
LookupClsMethodCache<clsName, methodName, namedEntity> S0:FramePtr

  Lookup a function in the class method targetcache. The class name and method
  name are clsName and methodName, respectively. S0 is the current vm frame
  pointer. Returns Nullptr if the method cannot be found using a subset of the
  required lookup paths, indicating that a more complete lookup path should be
  taken. May throw if the method does not exist.

D:Func = LdClsMethod S0:Cls S1:ConstInt

  Load a Func* off of the class method table for S0, at offset S1 (in method
  slots).

LookupClsMethod S0:Cls S1:Str S2:StkPtr S3:FramePtr

  Store a pointer to a class method into an activation record. S0 points to the
  class, S1 is the method name, S2 points to the activation record, and S3 is a
  pointer to the current frame (used to get the context). May throw or fatal if
  method is not accessible.

  global is not defined.

D:PtrToGen = LdGblAddrDef S0:Str

  it is not already defined.

D:PtrToGen = LdClsPropAddrKnown S0:ConstCls S1:ConstStr

  Loads a pointer to a static class property. S0 points to the class, and S1 is
  the property name. Should only be called when S0 is known statically, and
  when it is known to have a visible and accessible static property named S1.
  The type of D will be a Ptr of whatever type the static property has.

D:{PtrToGen|Nullptr} = LdClsPropAddrOrNull S0:Cls S1:Str S2:ConstCls

  Loads a pointer to a static class property. S0 points to the class, S1 is the
  property name, and S2 is the class representing the context of the code
  accessing the property. If class S0 does not have a visible and accessible
  static property named S1, then nullptr is returned.

D:PtrToGen = LdClsPropAddrOrRaise S0:Cls S1:Str S2:ConstCls

  Loads a pointer to a static class property. S0 points to the class, S1 is the
  property name, and S2 is the class representing the context of the code
  accessing the property. If class S0 does not have a visible and accessible
  static property named S1, throw a fatal error.

LdObjMethod<methodName,fatal> S0:Cls S1:StkPtr

  Stores a pointer to an object's method into an activation record. S0 points
  to the object's class, S1 points to the pre-live activation record.  Caches
  the mapping in the target cache. If `fatal' is true, raises a fatal if the
  class does not have an accessible method with the given name and does not
  have a __call method; otherwise (if `fatal' is false), raises a warning and
  puts func that does nothing and returns null (SystemLib::s_nullFunc) on the
  activation record.

D:Func = LdObjInvoke S0:Cls -> B

  Try to load a cached non-static __invoke Func from the Class in S0, or branch
  to block B if it is not present.

LdArrFuncCtx S0:Arr S1:StkPtr S2:FramePtr

  Try to load an array as a function context. This is for use translating
  FPushFunc when the callee is an array. This instruction attempts to populate
  a partially created ActRec pointed to by S1.

LdArrFPushCuf S0:Arr S1:StkPtr S2:FramePtr
LdStrFPushCuf S0:Str S1:StkPtr S2:FramePtr

  Try to resolve a method target for FPushCuf when the callee is an Arr or Str,
  respectively. These instructions mutate a partially created ActRec pointed to
  by S1.

D:Cls = LdObjClass S0:Obj

  Load the class out of the object in S0 and put it in D.

D:StaticStr = LdClsName S0:Cls

  Load the name of the Class* in S0.

D:Func = LdFunc S0:Str

  Loads the Func whose name is S0. Fatal if the named function is not defined,
  and the function autoloader fails to define it.

D:Func = LdFuncCached<funcName>

  Loads the Func whose name is funcName from the RDS, invoking autoload if it
  not defined yet. Fatal if function autoloader fails to define it.

D:Func = LdFuncCachedSafe<funcName> [ -> B ]

  Try to load the Func named funcName from the RDS. If the function is not
  defined, returns null and optionally branches to B.

D:Func = LdFuncCachedU<funcName,fallbackName>

  Try to load a Func named funcName from the RDS, if it isn't defined, try to
  load a Func named fallbackName. If that also isn't defined, invoke autoload.
  If this still doesn't result in a Func, raise a fatal error.

D:Func& = LdARFuncPtr S0:{StkPtr|FramePtr} S1:ConstInt

  Loads the m_func member of an ActRec. S0 is the base address, and S1 is an
  offset, such that S0 + S1 points to the base of the ActRec.

D:T = LdRaw<T> S0:?? S1:ConstInt

  "Raw" load from memory---i.e. outside of our type-system.

  S0 is the base address, and is an untyped pointer. S1 is a constant from the
  RawMemSlot::Kind enum, which describes the offset from the base, and the
  size. The value in D is assumed to be of type T.

D:BoxedCell = LdStaticLocCached<func,staticLocalName>

  Load the address of the static local RefData from the targetcache for
  function `func' with the static local variable named `staticLocalName'.

InitObjProps<class> S0:Obj

  Initializes properties of object S0.

  Call the custom instance constructor of an extension class.

D:Obj = CustomInstanceInit S0:Obj

  Call the custom instance initializer of object S0.

D:Arr = NewArray S0:ConstInt

  Allocate a new array with the expected capacity S0.

D:Arr = NewMixedArray S0:ConstInt

  Allocate a new array in mixed mode with the expected capacity S0.

D:Arr = NewLikeArrayL S0:Arr S1:ConstInt

  Allocate a new array in the same mode as S0 and with expected capacity S1,
  unless S1 == 0, in which case the capacity is set to S0's size.

D:Arr = NewPackedArray S0:ConstInt S1:StkPtr

  Allocate a new array by taking the top S0 elements off the stack given by S1.
  Note that this instruction assumes it can take the values from the stack
  without increfing them.

D:Arr = NewStructArray<keys...> S0:StkPtr

  Allocate a new key/value array, given N immediate keys and taking the top N
  elements off the stack given by S0. This instruction assumes it can take the
  values from the stack without increfing them.

  Create a new collection, with type S0 and size S1.

D:Obj = Clone S0:Obj

  Allocate an object by cloning S0.


9. Call & Return


D:StkPtr = SpillFrame<numArgs,invName> S0:StkPtr
                                       S1:{Func|Nullptr}
                                       S2:{Ctx|Class|Nullptr}

  Operands:

     S0 - caller stack pointer
     S1 - callee Func or nullptr
     S2 - object (for FPushObjMethod*), class (for FPushClsMethod*), context
          (for FPushClsMethodF), or nullptr (for FPushFunc*).

  Defines the fields for an activation record and writes them to the stack
  pointed to by S1.

D:StkPtr = CufIterSpillFrame<numArgs,iterId> S0:StkPtr
                                             S1:FramePtr

  Operands:

     S0 - caller stack pointer
     S1 - caller frame pointer

  Defines the fields for an activation record using data from the iterator
  iterId, and writes them to the stack pointed to by S1

D:FramePtr = FreeActRec S0:FramePtr

  Load the saved frame pointer from the activation record pointed to by S0 into
  D.

D:FramePtr = DefInlineFP<func,retBCOff,retSPOff> S0:StkPtr S1:StkPtr S2:FramePtr

  Defines a frame pointer for an inlined function. S0 is a StkPtr that points
  to the ActRec for the callee (i.e. after parameters have been popped). S1 is
  a StkPtr that represents what the inlined function will return to (i.e. it
  points to the stack after the ActRec in S0 is popped).

  `func' is the function being inlined. `retBCOff' and `retSPOff' represent
  what the bytecode and stack offsets should be after the FCall instruction in
  ther caller.

  This instruction is primarily used to represent a frame in the IR in a way
  that allows us to eliminate it entirely. When it cannot be eliminated (or if
  it is pushed into an unlikely path) it performs callee-side responsibilities
  for setting up an activation record (i.e. setting the return ip and m_soff,
  storing the frame pointer into D).

  The caller frame pointer is passed as S2. This is used to keep track of the
  call chain of inlined functions for simplification and dead code elimination.

InlineReturn S0:FramePtr

  Unlinks a frame constructed by DefInlineFP.

D:StkPtr = CallArray S0:StkPtr

  Invoke function corresponding to the current FPI with array args. S0 points
  to the stack resulting after the ActRec for the function and the array of its
  arguments is pushed. CallArray pops the array off the stack, pushes the
  elements of the array as arguments, and invokes the function in the ActRec.

D:StkPtr = Call<numParams,returnOff,funcd,destroyLocals> S0:StkPtr S1:FramePtr

  Transfer control to a callee, based on the pre-live activation record and set
  of args on the stack pointed to by S0. S1 is the current caller frame
  pointer. The `funcd' in the extra data is a Func* for the callee if we know
  the callee statically.

NativeImpl = S0:ConstFunc S1:FramePtr

  Execute a call to the native builtin specified by the func in S0.

D:T = CallBuiltin<T> S0...SN-1

  Call builtin function with N arguments.

  The source and destination types correspond to C++ parameter and return types
  as follows:

    C++ type            HHIR type         Position
    -----------------   ---------         --------
    bool                Bool              source, destination
    int64_t             Int               source, destination
    double              Dbl               source, destination
    const String&       PtrToString       source
    const Array&        PtrToArray        source
    const Object&       PtrToObject       source
    const Variant&      PtrToGen          source
    Variant&            PtrToGen          source (ref param)
    String              {Str|InitNull}    destination
    Array               {Arr|InitNull}    destination
    Object              {Obj|InitNull}    destination
    Variant             {Gen-UninitNull}  destination

D:RetAddr = LdRetAddr S0:FramePtr

  Load the return address off of the activation record pointed to by S0. The
  return address D is normally provided to a RetCtrl. Between a LdRetAddr and a
  RetCtrl, a FreeActRec is normally emitted to free the activation record S0.
  This is the reason why LdRetAddr is a separate instruction from RetCtrl.

RetCtrl S0:StkPtr S1:FramePtr S2:RetAddr

  Ensure that S0 is stored in rVmSp and S1 is stored in rVmFp and then execute
  a hardware procedure-return using the return address specified by S2.

StRetVal S0:FramePtr S1:Gen

  Writes the value in S1 to the return value slot on the activation record
  pointed to by S0.

D:StkPtr = RetAdjustStack S0:FramePtr

  Loads the new VM stack pointer into the destination. S0 is a pointer to the
  current activation record.

ReleaseVVOrExit S0:FramePtr -> B

  Loads the VarEnv slot off the ActRec pointed to by S0. If it is null, does
  nothing. If it is an ExtraArgs, deallocates the ExtraArgs structure.
  Otherwise jumps to block B.

GenericRetDecRefs S0:FramePtr

  Does decrefs of all the current function's locals, where S0 is a pointer to
  the relevant activation record.

  Semantically similar to a series of DecRefLoc.


10. Stores


StMem S0:PtrToGen S1:ConstInt S2:Gen

  Store S2 into the location S0 + S1 (in bytes).

StProp S0:Obj S1:Int S2:Gen

  Store S2 into the location S0 + S1 (in bytes).

StElem S0:PtrToCell S1:Int S2:Cell

  Store S2 into the location given by the index S1 from base pointer S0. The
  index in S1 is the number of bytes from the base in S0.

StLoc<localId> S0:FramePtr S1:Gen

  Store S1 to local number localId on the frame pointed to by S0.

StLocNT<localId> S0:FramePtr S1:Gen

  Store S1 to local number localId on the frame pointed to by S0, without
  storing the type.

StGbl<localId> S0:FramePtr S1:Gen

  Behaves just like StLoc, except the hard requirement that it is only emitted
  for globals. We don't optimize StGbl the same way as StLoc, as we need
  intraprocedural analysis to know whether the store is truly dead.

D:BoxedCell = StRef S0:BoxedCell S1:Cell

  Store the value in S1 into the RefData pointed to by S0. Stores the
  RefData::m_type also. Returns a new value for S0, which will now have the
  type of S1 after boxing.

StRaw S0:?? S1:ConstInt S2:??

  "Raw" store to memory---i.e. outside of our type-system.

  S0 is the base address, and is an untyped pointer. S1 is a constant from the
  RawMemSlot::Kind enum, which describes the offset from the base, and the
  size. The value in S2 depends on the value of S1.

D:StkPtr = SpillStack S0:StkP S1:ConstInt, S2...

  SpillStack synchronizes the virtual execution stack with the physical stack
  by storing a variadic list of SSATmps to the physical stack.

  Operands:

     S0      - current stack pointer

     S1      - stack deficit; indicates the number of elements that need to be
               logically popped before the variadic list is pushed

     S2...   - variadic list of elements to spill, with values representing
               cells. A temp with type None means to keep the previous value on
               the stack.


11. Trace exits


SyncABIRegs S0:FramePtr S1:StkPtr

  Ensures the cross-tracelet ABI registers are in a consistent state in
  preparation for an instruction that may leave the trace.

  In practice this instruction currently doesn't do anything except act as an
  essential instruction that prevents the current stack from being dce'd.

EagerSyncVMRegs S0:FramePtr S1:StkPtr

  Modify the vm register state for m_fp and m_sp in ExecutionContext to match
  S0 and S1.

ReqBindJmp<bcOff>

  Emit a jump to a REQ_BIND_JMP service request to the target offset bcOff.

ReqBindJmpNoIR<bcOff>

  Emit a jump to a REQ_BIND_JMP_NO_IR service request to the target offset
  bcOff. This is used for unsupported situations, where we need to leave the
  trace and want the "retranslation" to occur without using HHIR (i.e. interp).

ReqRetranslate

  Emit a jump to a service request that will chain to a retranslation of this
  tracelet.

  This instruction is used in exit traces for a type prediction that occurs at
  the first bytecode offset of a tracelet.

ReqRetranslateOpt<transID,bcOff>

  Emit a service request to retranslate, with a higher optimization gear,
  translation transID, which starts at bcOff. This instruction is used in exit
  traces that trigger profile-guided optimizations.

ReqBindJmpGt   ReqBindJmpGtInt
ReqBindJmpGte  ReqBindJmpGteInt
ReqBindJmpLt   ReqBindJmpLtInt
ReqBindJmpLte  ReqBindJmpLteInt
ReqBindJmpEq   ReqBindJmpEqInt
ReqBindJmpNeq  ReqBindJmpNeqInt
ReqBindJmpSame
ReqBindJmpNSame
ReqBindJmpInstanceOfBitmask
ReqBindJmpNInstanceOfBitmask
ReqBindJmpZero
ReqBindJmpNZero

  Test the condition based on the Jmp* op of similar name, and then emit a pair
  of smashable jumps to a REQ_BIND_JMPCC_FIRST service request.

SideExitJmpGt   SideExitJmpGtInt
SideExitJmpGte  SideExitJmpGteInt
SideExitJmpLt   SideExitJmpLtInt
SideExitJmpLte  SideExitJmpLteInt
SideExitJmpEq   SideExitJmpEqInt
SideExitJmpNeq  SideExitJmpNeqInt
SideExitJmpSame
SideExitJmpNSame
SideExitJmpInstanceOfBitmask
SideExitJmpNInstanceOfBitmask
SideExitJmpZero
SideExitJmpNZero

  Test the condition based on the Jmp* op of similar name, and then emit a
  smashable jump to a REQ_BIND_SIDE_EXIT service request.

D:FramePtr = SideExitGuardLoc<T,locId,takenOff> S0:FramePtr

  Test the type of a local, and if it fails jump to a side exit service
  request.

D:StkPtr = SideExitGuardStk<T,stackOff,takenOff> S0:StkPtr

  Test the type of a stack cell, and if it fails jump to a side exit service
  request.


12. Refcounting and copies


D:T = Mov S0:T

  Defines D as S0. May imply register-to-register moves at code generation
  time. Does not imply an incref or any other manipulation of S0.

TrackLoc<localId> S0:T

  Defines localId as having value given by S0.  This does not generate code; it
  is used by the translator to track values that are stored in locals. It can
  be thought of as a store (which does not physically store anything).

D:T* = LdMIStateAddr S0:T* S1:ConstInt

  Load an MInstrState address. Returns a pointer to (S0 + S1) with the same
  type as S0. S0 must be the output of a DefMIStateBase.

IncRef S0:Gen

  If S0 is a refcounted type, increment its refcount.

IncRefCtx S0:Ctx

  If the Ctx in S0 is a $this pointer, IncRef it.

DecRefLoc<localId> S0:FramePtr

  DecRef the local given by localId on the frame S0.

DecRefStack<T,offset> S0:StkPtr

  DecRef a value of type T at offset on the stack pointed to by S0.

DecRefThis S0:FramePtr

  DecRef the $this pointer in the ActRec S0, if it had one. Does nothing if
  there was a class context or null $this on the ActRec.

DecRef S0:Gen

  Decrease the reference count of S0 by one, and call a destructor for types
  that require it if it goes to zero.

  Note that although DecRef takes a Gen, we don't allow it to use information
  about the inner types of a BoxedCell. This is because we don't guard on the
  inner types of a BoxedCell except when doing LdRef. For any S0 that is a
  strict subtype of BoxedCell, the DecRef must just decref it as if it were a
  BoxedCell.

DecRefMem S0:PtrToGen S1:ConstInt

  Decref the value pointed to by S0 at offset S1 (in bytes), calling any
  appropriate destructor if the refcount goes to zero.

DecRefNZ S0:Gen

  Decrease the reference count of S0 by one, do not check if it goes to zero.
  This instruction can be used for more efficient code when it is provable that
  the reference count cannot go to zero.

TakeRef S0:Gen

  Produce reference, but do not modify the reference count. Used to inform
  refcount optimizer about implicitly owned references.


13. Misc


D:FramePtr = DefFP

  Creates a temporary D representing the current vm frame pointer.

D:StkPtr = DefSP<stackOff> S0:StkPtr

  Creates a temporary D representing the current vm stack pointer. S0 is a
  pointer to the current frame. The 'stackOff' is the logical offset between S0
  and the stack pointer, but in the case of generators this is not the
  physical offset at runtime.

  This instruction is used at the beginning of tracelets to represent the state
  of the stack on entry and does not emit code.

D:StkPtr = ReDefSP<offset,spansCall> S0:StkPtr S1:FramePtr

  Re-define a stack in terms of a frame pointer S1 and an offset, putting the
  resulting pointer in D. The resulting stack is assumed to give the same view
  as S0, which is a previous stack pointer. (I.e. for getStackValue we just
  chain to S0.)

  This instruction is used when entering or "returning" from an inlined call.
  The one used on entry will generally be DCE'd when the actrec can be
  eliminated. The one on exit is only needed until TODO(#2288359).

  The spansCall boolean is true if there is possibly a Call instructions
  between the definition of S0 and this instruction.

D:Int = Count S0:Cell

  Computes the number of elements in S0. The count of an array is the number of
  elements it contains, without recursing into containers in the array.
  Subtypes of Bool|Int|Dbl|Str|Res have a count of 1, subtypes of Null have a
  count of 0. The count of objects that implement the Countable interface is
  computed by returning the value of their count method. Objects that do not
  implement Countable have a count of 1.

D:Int = CountArray S0:Arr
D:Int = CountArrayFast S0:Arr
D:Int = CountCollection S0:Obj

  Computes the number of elements in S0 using the same definition as Count, but
  with a restriction on the input type.

  CountArray expects any array. CountArrayFast expects an array whose kind is not
  kNvtwKind. CountCollection expects a collection object.

Nop

  Does nothing. It's sometimes useful for the simplifier to insert one of these
  in the instruction stream.


14. Runtime helpers


VerifyParamCls S0:Cls S1:Cls S2:ConstInt

D:Arr = AddNewElem S0:Arr S1:Cell

  Add S1 as a new element to the array S0.  (Note: S1 must actually be a
  subtype of InitCell for array invariants, but we can't assert this yet in the

  Has the effects of the php + operator on the two source arrays.

D:Bool = AKExists S0:Cell S1:Cell

  Has the effects of array_key_exists(S0, S1). Note that S0 does not need to be

D:Int LdSwitchObjIndex S0:Obj S1:Int S2:Int

  These instructions are used to determine the target of a switch statement
  with target range [S1:S1 + S2), when invoked with the value S0. They call
  helper functions to check whether S0 is an numeric integer in the range
  [S1:S1 + S2), and if so return the value S1 - (Int)S0. Else, they return the
  target of the default target, S2 + 1.

D:StkPtr InterpOne<T, bcOff, numPopped, numPushed> S0:StkPtr S1:FramePtr

  type of the top stack element after the call. `bcOff' is the bytecode
  offset. `numPopped' is the number of stack cells consumed by the instruction,
  and `numPushed' is the number of stack cells produced by the
  instruction. This instruction returns the updated VM stack pointer.

  object in S0.

D:T LdContArRaw<T> S0:FramePtr S1:ConstInt

16. Debugging, instrumentation, and profiling


IncStat S0:ConstInt S1:ConstInt S2:ConstBool

  S1 is the amount to increment the counter (may be negative), and S2 is a
  'force' flag. This opcode becomes a noop iff (force == false and runtime
  stats are not enabled) at translation time.

IncStatGrouped S0:ConstStr S1:ConstStr S2:ConstInt

IncProfCounter<TransID>

  Increment the profiling counter associated with translation TransID.

DbgAssertRefCount S0:{Counted|StaticStr|StaticArr}

  Assert that S0 has a valid refcount. S0 must be a type with a valid (counted
  or static) _count field. If S0's count is implausible then execute a hardware
  trap instruction (int3 on x64).

DbgAssertPtr S0:PtrToGen

  Assert that S0 points to plausible TypedValue. If the TypedValue is a type
  with a _count field, check that the count field is plausible using the same
  logic as DbgAssertRefCount. Internally this uses always_assert(); failures
  cause an abort (whatever always_assert does).

DbgAssertType<T> S0:Cell

  Assert that S0 is of type T at runtime. If the assertion fails, execution is
  aborted via a hardware exception.

DbgAssertRetAddr

  Assert that the current hardware return address is the expected value. If the
  assertion fails, execution is aborted via a hardware exception.

17. Iterators


D:Bool = IterInit <IterData> S0:{Arr|Obj} S1:FramePtr
D:Bool = IterInitK <IterData> S0:{Arr|Obj} S1:FramePtr
D:Bool = WIterInit <IterData> S0:{Arr|Obj} S1:FramePtr
D:Bool = WIterInitK <IterData> S0:{Arr|Obj} S1:FramePtr
D:Bool = MIterInit <IterData> S0:{Arr|Obj} S1:FramePtr
D:Bool = MIterInitK <IterData> S0:{Arr|Obj} S1:FramePtr

  <IterData> consists of three indices, iterId, keyId and valId. iterId is
  the index of the iterator variable, keyId and valId are indices of local
  variables.

  Initializes the iterator variable whose index is given by iterId.
  This instruction creates the appropriate iterator for the array or object that
  S0 references, and rewinds the new iterator to its start. S0 points to the
  stack frame containing the iterator and local variables with the indices
  iterId, keyId and valId.

  If the new iterator is at its end (i.e., has no elements to iterate over),
  this instruction decrements the refcount of S0 and returns false; otheriwse,
  it stores a reference to S0 in the new iterator and returns true. If the
  iterator is not at its end, then this instruction stores the iterator's first
  value (and key) into the local variable with index valId (and keyId,
  respectively).

  The IterInit and IterInitK instructions always copy the array element by
  value.

  The WIterInit and WIterInitK instructions copy referenced array elements by
  reference, and non-referenced array elements by value.

  The MIterInit and MIterInitK instructions always copy the array element by
  reference.

  This instruction has the ConsumesRC property because it either decrements the
  reference count of s0 or stores a reference to S0 into the new iterator.

D:Bool = IterNext <IterData> S0:FramePtr
D:Bool = IterNextK <IterData> S0:FramePtr
D:Bool = WIterNext <IterData> S0:FramePtr
D:Bool = WIterNextK <IterData> S0:FramePtr
D:Bool = MIterNext <IterData> S0:FramePtr
D:Bool = MIterNextK <IterData> S0:FramePtr

  <IterData> consists of three indices, iterId, keyId and valId. iterId is
  the index of the iterator variable, keyId and valId are indices of local
  variables.  S0 points to the stack frame containing the iterator and local
  variables with the indices iterId, keyId and valId.

  Advances the iterator variable whose index is given by iterId.

  If the iterator has reached the end, this instruction frees the iterator
  variable and returns false; otherwise, it returns true. If the iterator has
  not reached its end, then this instruction stores the iterator's next value
  (and key) into the local variable with index valId (and keyId, respectively).

  The IterInit and IterInitK instructions always copy the array element by
  value. The WIterInit and WIterInitK instructions copy referenced array
  elements by reference, and non-referenced array elements by value. The
  MIterNext and MIterNextK instructions always copy the array element by
  reference.

IterFree<IterId> S0:FramePtr
MIterFree<IterId> S0:FramePtr

  Free the iterator variable whose index is given by S1 in the stack frame
  pointed to by S0.

D:Bool = DecodeCufIter<IterId> S0:{Arr|Obj|Str} S1:FramePtr

  Decode S0 as a callable, and write the decoded values to the iterator
  specified by IterId. Returns true iff it successfully decoded the callable.
  Does not raise warnings, or throw exceptions.

CIterFree<IterId> S0:FramePtr

  Free the iterator variable whose index is given by IterId in the stack frame
  pointed to by S0.


18. Member instruction support


D:PtrToCell = DefMIStateBase

  Declares a base register for MInstrState. Currently this is always %rsp.

All of the remaining opcodes in this section are simple wrappers around helper
functions (specified in S0) to perform the corresponding vector operation. If
S1 is a ConstCls it represents the context class for the operation.

SetElem, SetProp, and SetNewElem are used to implement part of the SetM hhbc
opcode, which almost always pushes its first stack input or a CountedStr as its
stack result. The combinations of input types that cause SetM to push anything
other than those two values are vanishingly rare in correct PHP programs, so
these three instructions have been optimized for the common cases. SetNewElem
and SetProp have no destination, allowing the compiler to predict that the
SetM's output will be the same as its input (and optimize accordingly). If that
turns out to not be the case at runtime, the instruction will throw an
InvalidSetMException. The exception will hold a Cell containing the value the
SetM should push on the stack instead of its input value. The runtime is
responsible for catching this exception, finishing execution of the SetM
instruction, pushing the value from the exception on the stack, and proceeding
as appropriate (most likely with a side exit to the next bytecode instruction,
since it has pushed an unexpected type onto the stack).

SetElem is similar to SetProp and SetNewElem but can also be used for setting
characters within strings. When given a string base and a valid offset, SetElem
returns a string representation of the newly inserted character. In all other
cases it returns nullptr or throws an InvalidSetMException. It will throw this
exception when it detects invalid input types, or when trying to set a string
offset that would grow the string beyond the maximum supported size.

The input types that will cause the errors described above are listed here:

SetNewElem will fail if the base is not a subtype of {Null|Str|Arr|Obj} and not
           Bool<false>.
SetElem has the same base constraint as SetNewElem. In addition, the key must
        not be a subtype of {Arr|Obj}.
SetProp will fail if the base is not a subtype of {Obj|Null}.

Any instructions that take a pointer to an MInstrState struct use the various
fields of that struct for holding intermediate values.

  Returns true iff the element at key S2 in S1 is set.

D:Bool = EmptyElem S0:ConstTCA S1:PtrToGen S2:Gen S3:PtrToCell

  Returns true iff the element at key S2 in S1 is set and not equal (as defined
  by the hhbc Eq instruction) to false.

CheckBounds S0:Int S1:Int

  Checks that the index in S0 is between 0 (included) and the values in S1
  (excluded). Throws if out of bounds.

ProfileArray S0:Arr

  Profile type of array S0 (i.e. whether it is packed or mixed).

ProfileStr<key> S0:PtrToStr

  Profile exact type of the value pointed to by S0.

CheckPackedArrayBounds S0:Arr S1:Int -> B

  Checks that the index in S1 is within the bounds of the packed array in S0.
  Branches to B if the index is out of bounds.

D:Bool = CheckPackedArrayElemNull S0:Arr S1:Int

  Returns true if the element at index S1 of the packed array in S0 is not
  null.

D:Cell = LdPackedArrayElem S0:Arr S1:Int

  Loads the element of the packed array in S0 at index S1.

D:Int = LdVectorSize S0:Obj<Vector>

  Returns the size of the given Vector in S0.

VectorHasFrozenCopy S0:Obj<Vector> -> B

  Checks if the Vector in S0 has live frozen vector copies and branches to B if
  so.

VectorDoCow S0:Obj<Vector>

  Triggers a copy on write for a Vector that has a live ImmVector sharing
  the same copy of the elements.

D:Obj = ColAddNewElemC S0:Obj S0:Cell

  Adds item S0 to the end of collection S0. Throws a fatal error if S0 is not a
  collection. Returns S0.

D:Obj = ColAddElemC S0:Obj S1:Cell S2:Cell

  Adds item to collection. Inserts item S2 into collection S0 at key S1.
  Throws a fatal error if S0 is not a collection. Returns S0.

D:Bool = ColIsEmpty S0:Obj
D:Bool = ColIsNEmpty S0:Obj

  Returns whether a collection instance is empty or not.  S0 must be known to
  be an instance of a collection class at compile time.
