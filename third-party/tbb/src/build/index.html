<A NAME="build"><H2>To Build</H2></A>
<P>
To port Intel TBB to a new platform, operating system or architecture, see the <A HREF="#port">porting directions</A> below.
</P>

<H3>Software prerequisites:</H3>
<OL>
<LI>C++ compiler for the platform, operating system and architecture of interest.
    Either the native compiler for your system, or, optionally, the appropriate Intel&reg; C++ Compiler, may be used.
<LI>GNU make utility. On Windows OS, if a UNIX* emulator is used to run GNU make,
    it should be able to run Windows OS utilities and commands. On Linux OS, macOS, etc.,
    shell commands issued by GNU make should execute in a Bourne or BASH compatible shell.
    In the following examples, replace <TT>make</TT> with the correct GNU make command for
    your system (for example, <TT>gmake</TT>). GNU make version 3.80 and more recent are supported.
</OL>

<P>
Intel TBB libraries can be built by performing the following steps.
On systems that support only one ABI (e.g., 32-bit), these steps build the libraries for that ABI.
On systems that support both 64-bit and 32-bit libraries, these steps build the 64-bit libraries
(Linux OS, macOS, and related systems) or whichever ABI is selected in the development environment (Windows OS).
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Change to the <A HREF="../index.html">top-level directory</A> of the installed software.
<LI>If using the Intel&reg; C++ Compiler, make sure the appropriate compiler is available in your PATH
    (e.g., by sourcing the appropriate iccvars script for the compiler to be used).
<LI>Invoke GNU make using no arguments, for example, <TT>make</TT>.
</OL>

<P>
To build Intel TBB libraries for other than the default ABI (e.g., to build 32-bit libraries on Linux OS, macOS,
or related systems that support both 64-bit and 32-bit libraries), perform the following steps:
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Change to the <A HREF="../index.html">top-level directory</A> of the installed software.
<LI>If using the Intel&reg; C++ Compiler, make sure the appropriate compiler is available in your PATH
    (e.g., by sourcing the appropriate iccvars script for the compiler to be used).
<LI>Explicitly specify the architecture when invoking GNU make, e.g. <TT>make arch=ia32</TT>.
</OL>

<P>The default make target will build the release and debug versions of the Intel TBB library.</P>
<P>Other targets are available in the top-level Makefile. You might find the following targets useful:
<UL>
<LI><TT>make test</TT> will build and run Intel TBB <A HREF="../src/test">unit-tests</A>;
<LI><TT>make examples</TT> will build and run Intel TBB <A HREF="../examples/index.html">examples</A>. Available in the open-source version only.
For the commercial version, you can download Intel TBB Samples at the <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/product-code-samples?topic=20828">Intel&reg; Software Product Samples and Tutorials</a> website;
<LI><TT>make all</TT> will do all of the above. Available in the open-source version only.
</UL>
See also the list of other targets below.
</P>

<P>
By default, the libraries will be built in sub-directories within the build/ directory.
The sub-directories are named according to the operating system, architecture, compiler and software environment used
(the sub-directory names also distinguish release vs. debug libraries).  On Linux OS, the software environment comprises
the GCC, libc and kernel version used.  On macOS, the software environment comprises the GCC and OS version used.
On Windows OS, the software environment comprises the Microsoft* Visual Studio* version used.
See below for how to change the default build directory.
</P>

<P>
To perform different build and/or test operations, use the following steps.
</P>
<OL>
<LI>Change to the <A HREF="../index.html">top-level directory</A> of the installed software.
<LI>If using the Intel&reg; C++ Compiler, make sure the appropriate compiler is available in your PATH
    (e.g., by sourcing the appropriate iccvars script for the compiler to be used).
<LI>Invoke GNU make by using one or more of the following commands.

<A NAME="port"><H2>To Port</H2></A>
<P>
This section provides information on how to port Intel TBB to a new platform, operating system or architecture.
A subset or a superset of these steps may be required for porting to a given platform.
</P>

<H4>To port the Intel TBB source code:</H4>
<OL>
<LI>If porting to a new architecture, create a file that describes the architecture-specific details for that architecture.
    <UL>
    <LI>Create a &lt;os&gt;_&lt;architecture&gt;.h file in the <A HREF="../include/tbb/machine">include/tbb/machine</A> directory
	that describes these details.
	<UL>
	<LI>The &lt;os&gt;_&lt;architecture&gt;.h is named after the operating system and architecture as recognized by
	    <A HREF="../include/tbb/tbb_machine.h">include/tbb/tbb_machine.h</A> and the Makefile infrastructure.
	<LI>This file defines the implementations of synchronization operations, and also the
	    scheduler yield function, for the operating system and architecture.
	<LI>Several examples of &lt;os&gt;_&lt;architecture&gt;.h files can be found in the
	    <A HREF="../include/tbb/machine">include/tbb/machine</A> directory.
	    <UL>
	    <LI>A minimal implementation defines the 4-byte and 8-byte compare-and-swap operations,
		and the scheduler yield function.  See <A HREF="../include/tbb/machine/mac_ppc.h">include/tbb/machine/mac_ppc.h</A>
		for an example of a minimal implementation.
	    <LI>More complex implementation examples can also be found in the
		<A HREF="../include/tbb/machine">include/tbb/machine</A> directory
		that implement all the individual variants of synchronization operations that Intel TBB uses.
		Such implementations are more verbose but may achieve better performance on a given architecture.
	    <LI>In a given implementation, any synchronization operation that is not defined is implemented, by default,
		in terms of 4-byte or 8-byte compare-and-swap.  More operations can thus be added incrementally to increase
		the performance of an implementation.
	    <LI>In most cases, synchronization operations are implemented as inline assembly code; examples also exist,
		(e.g., for Intel&reg; Itanium&reg; processors) that use out-of-line assembly code in *.s or *.asm files
		(see the assembly code sub-directories in the <A HREF="../src/tbb">src/tbb</A> directory).
	    </UL>
	</UL>
    <LI>Modify <A HREF="../include/tbb/tbb_machine.h">include/tbb/tbb_machine.h</A>, if needed, to invoke the appropriate
	&lt;os&gt;_&lt;architecture&gt;.h file in the <A HREF="../include/tbb/machine">include/tbb/machine</A> directory.
    </UL>
<LI>Add an implementation of DetectNumberOfWorkers() in <A HREF="../src/tbb/tbb_misc.h">src/tbb/tbb_misc.h</A>,
    that returns the number of cores found on the system in case it is not supported by the current implementation.  
    This is used to determine the default number of threads for the Intel TBB task scheduler.
<LI>Either properly define FillDynamicLinks for use in
    <A HREF="../src/tbb/cache_aligned_allocator.cpp">src/tbb/cache_aligned_allocator.cpp</A>,
    or hardcode the allocator to be used.
<LI>Additional types might be required in the union defined in
    <A HREF="../include/tbb/aligned_space.h">include/tbb/aligned_space.h</A>
    to ensure proper alignment on your platform.
<LI>Changes may be required in <A HREF="../include/tbb/tick_count.h">include/tbb/tick_count.h</A>
    for systems that do not provide gettimeofday.
</OL>

<H4>To port the Makefile infrastructure:</H4>
Modify the appropriate files in the Makefile infrastructure to add a new platform, operating system or architecture as needed.
See the Makefile infrastructure files for examples.
<OL>
<LI>The <A HREF="../Makefile">top-level Makefile</A> includes <A HREF="common.inc">common.inc</A> to determine the operating system.
    <UL>
    <LI>To add a new operating system, add the appropriate test to <A HREF="common.inc">common.inc</A>, and create the needed &lt;os&gt;.inc and &lt;os&gt;.&lt;compiler&gt;.inc files (see below).
    </UL>
<LI>The &lt;os&gt;.inc file makes OS-specific settings for a particular operating systems.
    <UL>
    <LI>For example, <A HREF="linux.inc">linux.inc</A> makes settings specific to Linux operating systems.
    <LI>This file performs OS-dependent tests to determine the specific platform and/or architecture, and sets other platform-dependent values.
    <LI>Add a new &lt;os&gt;.inc file for each new operating system added.
    </UL>
<LI>The &lt;os&gt;.&lt;compiler&gt;.inc file makes compiler-specific settings for a particular
    &lt;os&gt; / &lt;compiler&gt; combination.
    <UL>
    <LI>For example, <A HREF="linux.gcc.inc">linux.gcc.inc</A> makes specific settings for using GCC on Linux OS, and <A HREF="linux.icc.inc">linux.icc.inc</A> makes specific settings for using the Intel&reg; C++ compiler on Linux OS.
    <LI>This file sets particular compiler, assembler and linker options required when using a particular &lt;os&gt; / &lt;compiler&gt; combination.
    <LI>Add a new &lt;os&gt;.&lt;compiler&gt;.inc file for each new &lt;os&gt; / &lt;compiler&gt; combination added.
