<h2>SSL Server Setup</h2>

1. Prepare Certificates

Prepare two files: one certificate file and one key file. Make sure they are
readable by the user account that runs web server.

2. Configuration Change

Prepare configurations like this,

  Server {
    EnableSSL = true
    SSLPort = 443
    SSLCertificateFile = /full_path_to_certificate
    SSLCertificateKeyFile = /full_path_to_certificate_file
  }
