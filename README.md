# HipHop for PHP

"HipHop for PHP" is an open source project developed by Facebook. HipHop offers a PHP execution engine called the "HipHop Virtual Machine" (HHVM) which uses a just-in-time compilation approach to achieve superior performance. Using HipHop VM (and before it HPHPc) Facebook has achieved more than 5x increase in throughput as compared with Zend PHP 5.2.
