    Shared memory heap containing the contents of files.
    Acts as a sort of caching facade which is filled on-demand
    as contents are needed - The "cache" is filled by loading from
    the file system if the file isn't opened in the IDE
    (otherwise uses the IDE contents).
    That is, the IDE version take precedence over file system's.
