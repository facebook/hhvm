Included from CythonClients.pyx, this file defines the core adapter between the
C++ async future calls and Python asyncio futures. The C++ classes defined in
ClientsWrapper.h and ClientsWrapper.cpp take these callbacks and call into them
from the IO thread. The callbacks examine the result, extract the exception if
one occurred, and then schedule setting the result on the future to be safely
executed in the asyncio loop.
