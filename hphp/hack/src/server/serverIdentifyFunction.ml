(* Identifying a symbol can be a first step to another operation. For example,
 * you can identify symbol and then highlight other "equal" symbols.
 * get_occurrence_and_map is useful for such application, because ~f function
 * will execute in the same environment that the symbol was identified -
 * content ASTs and defs will still be available in shared memory for the
 * subsequent operation. *)
