children
---
`children` declares which XHP types may be used as children when creating instances of this class.

For example, `children (:p)+` means that users may write `<my-class><p>hello</p><p>world</p></my_class>`.

**`children` is not enforced by the type checker**, but an XHP framework can choose to validate it at runtime.
