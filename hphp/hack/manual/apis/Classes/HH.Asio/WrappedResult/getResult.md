This is a point-in-time snapshot of the API documentation from January 2026.
Going forward, we will not be maintaining a public copy of these references,
and recommend users to refer to the built-in signature helpers available in
the Hack LSP instead for complete and up-to-date information.

Since this is a successful result wrapper, this always returns the actual
result of the [` Awaitable `](/apis/Classes/HH/Awaitable/) operation




``` Hack
public function getResult(): T;
```




## Returns




+ ` T ` - The result of the [` Awaitable `](/apis/Classes/HH/Awaitable/) operation.
