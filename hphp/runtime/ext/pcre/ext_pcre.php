 *   available, including the deprecated 'e' (PREG_REPLACE_EVAL), which is
 *   specific to this function.
 * @param mixed $replacement - The string or an array with strings to
 *   replace. If this parameter is a string and the pattern parameter is an
 *   array, all patterns will be replaced by that string. If both pattern
 *   and replacement parameters are arrays, each pattern will be replaced
 *   by the replacement counterpart. If there are fewer elements in the
 *   replacement array than in the pattern array, any extra patterns will
 *   be replaced by an empty string.   replacement may contain references
 *   of the form \\n or (since PHP 4.0.4) $n, with the latter form being
 *   the preferred one. Every such reference will be replaced by the text
 *   captured by the n'th parenthesized pattern. n can be from 0 to 99, and
 *   \\0 or $0 refers to the text matched by the whole pattern. Opening
 *   parentheses are counted from left to right (starting from 1) to obtain
 *   the number of the capturing subpattern. To use backslash in
 *   replacement, it must be doubled ("\\\\" PHP string).   When working
 *   with a replacement pattern where a backreference is immediately
 *   followed by another number (i.e.: placing a literal number immediately
 *   after a matched pattern), you cannot use the familiar \\1 notation for
 *   your backreference. \\11, for example, would confuse preg_replace()
 *   since it does not know whether you want the \\1 backreference followed
 *   by a literal 1, or the \\11 backreference followed by nothing. In this
 *   case the solution is to use \${1}1. This creates an isolated $1
 *   backreference, leaving the 1 as a literal.   When using the deprecated
 *   e modifier, this function escapes some characters (namely ', ", \ and
 *   NULL) in the strings that replace the backreferences. This is done to
 *   ensure that no syntax errors arise from backreference usage with
 *   either single or double quotes (e.g. 'strlen(\'$1\')+strlen("$2")').
 *   Make sure you are aware of PHP's string syntax to know exactly how the
 *   interpreted string will look.
 * @param mixed $subject - The string or an array with strings to search
 *   and replace.   If subject is an array, then the search and replace is
 *   performed on every entry of subject, and the return value is an array
 *   as well.
 * @param int $limit - The maximum possible replacements for each pattern
 *   in each subject string. Defaults to -1 (no limit).
 * @param int $count - If specified, this variable will be filled with
 *   the number of replacements done.
 *
 * @return mixed - preg_replace() returns an array if the subject
 *   parameter is an array, or a string otherwise.   If matches are found,
