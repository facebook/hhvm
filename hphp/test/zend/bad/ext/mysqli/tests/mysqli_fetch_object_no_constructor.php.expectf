No exception with PHP:
object(mysqli_fetch_object_test)#%d (%d) {
  [%u|b%"a"]=>
  NULL
  [%u|b%"b"]=>
  NULL
}

Exception with mysqli. Note that at all other places we throws errors but no exceptions unless the error mode has been changed:
Exception: Class mysqli_fetch_object_test does not have a constructor hence you cannot use ctor_params

Fatal error with PHP (but no exception!):
