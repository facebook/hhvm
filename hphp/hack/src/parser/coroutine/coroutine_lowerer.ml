 Lowers all coroutines found in a script

 We are working around a significant shortcoming of HHVM here.  We are supposed
 to have an invariant that the order in which type declarations appear in a
 Hack file is irrelevant, but this is not the case:

 interface I {}
 class B implements I {}
 new D(); // Crashes here at runtime
 class D extends B {}

 The crash is due to a peculiarity in how HHVM handles interfaces.

 The closure classes extend the closure base, which implements an interface.
 We can therefore very easily get into this situation when generating closure
 classes at the end of a file.

 What we do then is gather up *all* the classes in a file, sort them to the
 top of the file, follow them with the closure classes, and then the rest
 of the code in the file.

 This unfortunate code can be removed when the bug is fixed in HHVM, and
 we can simply append the closure classes to the end of the list of
 declarations.
