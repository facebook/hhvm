  When enabled, duk_hstring charlen is computed only when accessed; because
  the charlen of most strings is not accessed during their lifetime, this
  reduces unnecessary charlen calculations.  When disabled, charlen is computed
  during interning which has smaller code footprint at slightly slower charlen
  handling.
