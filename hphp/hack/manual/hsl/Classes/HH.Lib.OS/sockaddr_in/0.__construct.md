:::info[Note]
This is a point-in-time snapshot of the API documentation from January 2026.
Going forward, we will not be maintaining a public copy of these references,
and recommend users to refer to the built-in signature helpers available in
the Hack LSP instead for complete and up-to-date information.
:::

Construct a ` sockaddr_in `




``` Hack
public function __construct(
  int $port,
  HH\Lib\OS\in_addr $address,
);
```




Unlike the C API, all integers are in host byte order, not network byte
order.




## Parameters




+ ` int $port `
+ ` HH\Lib\OS\in_addr $address `
<!-- HHAPIDOC -->
