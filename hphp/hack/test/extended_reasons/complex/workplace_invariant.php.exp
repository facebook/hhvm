Here's why:


  Step 1 of 5                                                                   

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this implicitly defined constant ::class of class \foo

File workplace_invariant.php, line 8, character 13 - line 8, character 15:

 7 | 
 8 | final class »foo« implements bar<int> {

 14 | 
 15 | function getClass<Tu as num>(): classname<bar<Tu>> {
 16 |     return »foo::class«;
 17 | }

as the type of the constant

which itself flows into this expression

File workplace_invariant.php, line 16, character 5 - line 16, character 22:

 14 | 
 15 | function getClass<Tu as num>(): classname<bar<Tu>> {
 16 |     »return foo::class;«
 17 | }

because it is used in a return position

The supertype comes from this hint

File workplace_invariant.php, line 15, character 33 - line 15, character 50:

 14 | 
 15 | function getClass<Tu as num>(): »classname<bar<Tu>>« {

(its definition was given above)


  Step 2 of 5                                                                   

classname is a newtype so next I checked the 1st type arguments.

 14 | 
 15 | function getClass<Tu as num>(): classname<bar<Tu>> {

The subtype extends or implements the supertype class or interface so next I checked that subtype constraint.

bar is a class or interface so next I checked the 1st type arguments are subtypes.
The type parameter is invariant so the subtype relationship must hold in both directions.
Here I check the contravariant case so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed.

The subtype comes from this hint

  Step 5 of 5                                 (here is where the error occurred) 

The subtype declares an upper bound so next I checked that was a subtype of the supertype.
