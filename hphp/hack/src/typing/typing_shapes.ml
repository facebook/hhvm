(* Typing rule for Shapes::idx($s, field, [default])

  Shapes::idx has type res (or Toption res, if res is not already Toption _ and
  default is not provided), where res is the inferred type of field (provided by
  $s, or else Tmixed). If default is provided, then res must be a subtype of
  Tunresolved[default].

  Ensures that $s is a shape. $s must be a subtype of:
  shape(...) -- if experimental_shape_idx_relaxed and $s does not contain field
                and does not unset field; i.e. it is possible for an instance of
                $s to provide the field with an arbitrary type.
                (This will emit a lint warning)

  shape(field => ?Tmixed, ...)  -- otherwise
