# Dune aggressivly cleans its' build directory, so the generated HHIs have to
# be outside of Dune's build directory
#
# If you're doing a Hack+HHVM out-of-source build (recommended), it'll still put
# them in the main build directory, but if you're doing an in-source build,
# the files will be here.
