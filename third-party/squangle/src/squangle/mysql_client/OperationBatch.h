// The OperationBatch is a class that allows waiting only for a
// certain set of operations. All the operations (Connect, Query)
// must be added to the batch and then drain() can be called to
// wait for completion.
//
// It is useful for parallel queries. Because usually
// the FbAsyncMysqlClient::defaultClient() will be used and it is
// shared among all the threads, calling drain on the client is not
// an option. This class allows waiting only on the operations started
// by that thread.
// An usage example can be found in the TestOperationBatch UNITTEST
// from the AsyncMysqlTest.cpp file.
