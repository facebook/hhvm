(* Takes two continuation maps m1 (`locals`) and m2 (`source_locals`) and
 * a continuation c (`cont`) and basically perform m1[c] <= m2[c].
 *
 * When entering certain control flow structures, certain
 * preexisting continuations must be stashed away and then _restored_
 * via this function on exiting those control flow structures.
 *
 * For example, on entering a loop, preexisting 'break' and 'continue'
 * continuations from any enclosing loops must be stashed away so as not to
 * interfere with them. *)

 * continuation, or at the beginning of a loop block, we merge the 'continue'
 * continuation into the 'next' continuation. *)

 * continuation.

(* Unions two context options. We call "context" here a map from locals to
 * types.
 * Intersect the set of keys, and for each key in both contexts, union their
 * associated types.
 * More formally, the union c1 & c2 of contexts
 * c1 and c2 is defined as:
 * (x: T) belongs to c1 & c2 iif there exist T1, T2 such that:
 *   - (x: T1) belongs to c1
 *   - (x: T2) belongs to c2
 *   - T = T1 | T2
 *
 * Example:
 *   context1 = { x: A, y: B }
 *   context2 = { z: C, y: D }
 *   union context1 context2 = { y: (B|D) }
