description: >
  Use this to skip byte order detection and force a specific byte order:
  1 for little endian, 2 for ARM "mixed" endian (integers little endian,
  IEEE doubles mixed endian), 3 for big endian.  Byte order detection
  relies on unstandardized platform specific header files, so this may be
  required for custom platforms if compilation fails in endianness detection.
