(** Inbound closure: every file that transitively depends on a given file.

    Upward-closed over files — not merely over symbols — so nothing outside a
    closure references into it and it is safe to take whole. Take part of one
    and that stops being true. *)

(** [get ctx naming_table ~max path] is the closure of [path], including [path]
    itself; [None] when it passes [max] files, or when the naming table does not
    know [path].

    Memoised on [path] alone, so a caller that varies [max] must [reset] between.

    Master-only: a forked worker sees the memory-mapped [base] graph but not the
    [delta] on the master's heap, so it may be trusted to say a closure is too
    large, never that one is complete. *)

(** Drop the accepted closures, keep the refusals. Closures are expensive to
    hold and cheap to recompute; refusals are the reverse. *)
val release_closures : unit -> unit

(** Drop everything, refusals included, and zero the counters. Entries outlive a
    call, so a caller must reset before a run or risk a closure computed from a
    file's earlier contents, or under a different [max]. *)
