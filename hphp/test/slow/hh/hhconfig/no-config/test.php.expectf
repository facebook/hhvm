Fatal error: %s/no-config/test.php appears to be a Hack file, but you do not appear to be running the Hack typechecker. See the documentation at http://docs.hhvm.com/hack/typechecker/setup for information on getting it running. You can also set `-d hhvm.hack.lang.look_for_typechecker=0` to disable this check (not recommended).
