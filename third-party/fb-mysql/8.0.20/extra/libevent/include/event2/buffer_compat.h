/** Type definition for a callback that is invoked whenever data is added or
    removed from an evbuffer.

    An evbuffer may have one or more callbacks set at a time.  The order
    in which they are executed is undefined.

    A callback function may add more callbacks, or remove itself from the
    list of callbacks, or add or remove data from the buffer.  It may not
    remove another callback from the list.

    If a callback adds or removes data from the buffer or from another
    buffer, this can cause a recursive invocation of your callback or
    other callbacks.  If you ask for an infinite loop, you might just get
    one: watch out!

  Replace all callbacks on an evbuffer with a single new callback, or

  Subsequent calls to evbuffer_setcb() replace callbacks set by previous

  @deprecated This function is deprecated because it clears all previous
     callbacks set on the evbuffer, which can cause confusing behavior if
     multiple parts of the code all want to add their own callbacks on a
     buffer.  Instead, use evbuffer_add(), evbuffer_del(), and
     evbuffer_setflags() to manage your own evbuffer callbacks without
     interfering with callbacks set by others.
