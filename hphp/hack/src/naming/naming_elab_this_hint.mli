(* This combined elaboration and validation pass will:
   - Canonicalise `Happly(...)` hints coming from the lowerer
   - Canonicalise `varray`, `darray` and `varray_or_darray` type hints
   - Replace invalid hints with `Herr` and raise errors
   - Validate use of `self`, `this`, `parent` and `static` type hints
   - Elaborate missing type parameters to builtin collections to `Hany`
   - Validate the arity of certain builtin collections
