description: >
  Provide declarations or additional preprocessor include directives to be
  used when compiling Duktape.  You may need this if you set
  DUK_USE_PANIC_HANDLER to call your own panic handler function.  You can
  also use this option to cause additional files to be included when compiling
  Duktape.

  NOTE: This is only needed if using the default autodetecting duk_config.h
  header.  When providing DUK_USE_xxx flags directly, you should just provide
  all the necessary declarations in duk_config.h directly.

# FIXME: to be removed?
