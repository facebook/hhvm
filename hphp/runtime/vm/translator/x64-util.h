/*
 * TLS access: XXX we currently only support static-style TLS directly
 * linked off of FS.
 *
 * x86 terminology review: "Virtual addresses" are subject to both
 * segmented translation and paged translation. "Linear addresses" are
 * post-segmentation address, subject only to paging. C and C++ generally
 * only have access to bitwise linear addresses.
 *
 * TLS data live at negative virtual addresses off FS: the first datum
 * is typically at VA(FS:-sizeof(datum)). Linux's x64 ABI stores the linear
 * address of the base of TLS at VA(FS:0). While this is just a convention, it
 * is firm: gcc builds binaries that assume it when, e.g., evaluating
 * "&myTlsDatum".
 *
 * The virtual addresses of TLS data are not exposed to C/C++. To figure it
 * out, we take a datum's linear address, and subtract it from the linear
 * address where TLS starts. If you use the void* variant here, it's up to
 * the programmer to ensure that it really is a TLS address.
