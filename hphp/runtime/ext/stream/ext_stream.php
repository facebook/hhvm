/**
 * The stream_select() function accepts arrays of streams and waits for them

 *
 * @param mixed $read - The streams listed in the read array will be watched
 *   to see if characters become available for reading (more precisely, to see
 *   if a read will not block - in particular, a stream resource is also ready
 *   on end-of-file, in which case an fread() will return a zero length string).
 * @param mixed $write - The streams listed in the write array will be watched
 *   to see if a write will not block.
 * @param mixed $except - The streams listed in the except array will be
 *   watched for high priority exceptional ("out-of-band") data arriving.  When
 *   stream_select() returns, the arrays read, write and except are modified to
 *   indicate which stream resource(s) actually changed status. You do not need
 *   to pass every array to stream_select(). You can leave it out and use an
 *   empty array or NULL instead. Also do not forget that those arrays are
 *   passed by reference and will be modified after stream_select() returns.
 * @param mixed $vtv_sec - The tv_sec and tv_usec together form the timeout
 *   parameter, tv_sec specifies the number of seconds while tv_usec the number
 *   of microseconds. The timeout is an upper bound on the amount of time that
 *   stream_select() will wait before it returns. If tv_sec and tv_usec are both
 *   set to 0, stream_select() will not wait for data - instead it will return
 *   immediately, indicating the current status of the streams.  If tv_sec is
 *   NULL stream_select() can block indefinitely, returning only when an event
 *   on one of the watched streams occurs (or if a signal interrupts the system
 *   call). Warning  Using a timeout value of 0 allows you to instantaneously
 *   poll the status of the streams, however, it is NOT a good idea to use a 0
 *   timeout value in a loop as it will cause your script to consume too much
 *   CPU time.  It is much better to specify a timeout value of a few seconds,
 *   although if you need to be checking and running other code concurrently,
 *   using a timeout value of at least 200000 microseconds will help reduce the
 *   CPU usage of your script.  Remember that the timeout value is the maximum
 *   time that will elapse; stream_select() will return as soon as the requested
 *   streams are ready for use.
 * @param int $tv_usec - See tv_sec description.
 *
 * @return mixed - On success stream_select() returns the number of stream
 *   resources contained in the modified arrays, which may be zero if the
 *   timeout expires before anything interesting happens. On error FALSE is
 *   returned and a warning raised (this can happen if the system call is
