As of MySQL 8\&.0\&.16, the MySQL server performs the upgrade tasks previously handled by
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
(for details, see
Section\ \&2.11.3, \(lqWhat the MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades\(rq)\&. Consequently,
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
is unneeded and is deprecated as of that version, and will be removed in a future MySQL version\&. Because
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
no longer performs upgrade tasks, it exits with status 0 unconditionally\&.

Each time you upgrade MySQL, you should execute
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR, which looks for incompatibilities with the upgraded MySQL server:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

It upgrades the system tables in the
mysql
schema so that you can take advantage of new privileges or capabilities that might have been added\&.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c

.el \{\

It upgrades the Performance Schema,
INFORMATION_SCHEMA, and
sys

.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

It examines user schemas\&.
.RE
.PP
If
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
finds that a table has a possible incompatibility, it performs a table check and, if problems are found, attempts a table repair\&. If the table cannot be repaired, see
Section\ \&2.11.13, \(lqRebuilding or Repairing Tables or Indexes\(rq
for manual table repair strategies\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
communicates directly with the MySQL server, sending it the SQL statements required to perform an upgrade\&.

You should always back up your current MySQL installation
\fIbefore\fR
performing an upgrade\&. See
Section\ \&7.2, \(lqDatabase Backup Methods\(rq\&.
.PP
Some upgrade incompatibilities may require special handling
\fIbefore\fR
upgrading your MySQL installation and running
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR\&. See
Section\ \&2.11, \(lqUpgrading MySQL\(rq, for instructions on determining whether any such incompatibilities apply to your installation and how to handle them\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
Use
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
like this:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c

.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2

Invoke
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
to upgrade the system tables in the
mysql
schema and check and repair tables in other schemas:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
shell> \fBmysql_upgrade [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  3." 4.2

Stop the server and restart it so that any system table changes take effect\&.
.RE
.PP
If you have multiple MySQL server instances to upgrade, invoke
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
with connection parameters appropriate for connecting to each of the desired servers\&. For example, with servers running on the local host on parts 3306 through 3308, upgrade each of them by connecting to the appropriate port:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql_upgrade \-\-protocol=tcp \-P 3306 [\fR\fB\fIother_options\fR\fR\fB]\fR
shell> \fBmysql_upgrade \-\-protocol=tcp \-P 3307 [\fR\fB\fIother_options\fR\fR\fB]\fR
shell> \fBmysql_upgrade \-\-protocol=tcp \-P 3308 [\fR\fB\fIother_options\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
For local host connections on Unix, the
\fB\-\-protocol=tcp\fR
option forces a connection using TCP/IP rather than the Unix socket file\&.
.PP
By default,
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
runs as the MySQL
root
user\&. If the
root
password is expired when you run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR, you will see a message that your password is expired and that
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
failed as a result\&. To correct this, reset the
root
password to unexpire it and run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
again\&. First, connect to the server as
root:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql \-u root \-p\fR
Enter password: \fB****\fR  <\- enter root password here
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Reset the password using
ALTER USER:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
mysql> \fBALTER USER USER() IDENTIFIED BY \*(Aq\fR\fB\fIroot\-password\fR\fR\fB\*(Aq;\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Then exit
\fBmysql\fR
and run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
again:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
shell> \fBmysql_upgrade [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB]\fR

.PP
If you run the server with the
disabled_storage_engines
system variable set to disable certain storage engines (for example,
MyISAM),
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
might fail with an error like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
mysql_upgrade: [ERROR] 3161: Storage engine MyISAM is disabled
(Table creation is disallowed)\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To handle this, restart the server with
disabled_storage_engines
disabled\&. Then you should be able to run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
successfully\&. After that, restart the server with
disabled_storage_engines
set to its original value\&.
.sp .5v
.RE
.PP
Unless invoked with the
\fB\-\-upgrade\-system\-tables\fR
option,
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
processes all tables in all user schemas as necessary\&. Table checking might take a long time to complete\&. Each table is locked and therefore unavailable to other sessions while it is being processed\&. Check and repair operations can be time\-consuming, particularly for large tables\&. Table checking uses the
FOR UPGRADE
option of the
CHECK TABLE
statement\&. For details about what this option entails, see
Section\ \&13.7.3.2, \(lqCHECK TABLE Statement\(rq\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
marks all checked and repaired tables with the current MySQL version number\&. This ensures that the next time you run
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
with the same version of the server, it can be determined whether there is any need to check or repair a given table again\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
saves the MySQL version number in a file named
mysql_upgrade_info
in the data directory\&. This is used to quickly check whether all tables have been checked for this release so that table\-checking can be skipped\&. To ignore this file and perform the check regardless, use the
\fB\-\-force\fR
option\&.

\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
checks
mysql\&.user
system table rows and, for any row with an empty
plugin
column, sets that column to
\*(Aqmysql_native_password\*(Aq
if the credentials use a hash format compatible with that plugin\&. Rows with a pre\-4\&.1 password hash must be upgraded manually\&.
.PP
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
does not upgrade the contents of the time zone tables or help tables\&. For upgrade instructions, see
Section\ \&5.1.13, \(lqMySQL Server Time Zone Support\(rq, and
Section\ \&5.1.14, \(lqServer-Side Help Support\(rq\&.
.PP
Unless invoked with the
\fB\-\-skip\-sys\-schema\fR
option,
\fBmysql_upgrade\fR
installs the
sys
schema if it is not installed, and upgrades it to the current version otherwise\&. An error occurs if a
sys
schema exists but has no
version
view, on the assumption that its absence indicates a user\-created schema:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
A sys schema exists with no sys\&.version view\&. If
you have a user created sys schema, this must be renamed for the
upgrade to succeed\&.

\fB\-\-server\-public\-key\-path=\fR\fB\fIfile_name\fR\fR
.sp
The path name to a file containing a client\-side copy of the public key required by the server for RSA key pair\-based password exchange\&. The file must be in PEM format\&. This option applies to clients that authenticate with the
sha256_password
or
caching_sha2_password
authentication plugin\&. This option is ignored for accounts that do not authenticate with one of those plugins\&. It is also ignored if RSA\-based password exchange is not used, as is the case when the client connects to the server using a secure connection\&.
.sp
If
\fB\-\-server\-public\-key\-path=\fR\fB\fIfile_name\fR\fR
is given and specifies a valid public key file, it takes precedence over
\fB\-\-get\-server\-public\-key\fR\&.
.sp
For
sha256_password, this option applies only if MySQL was built using OpenSSL\&.

sha256_password

caching_sha2_password
plugins, see
