           ("Who watches the Watchmen?")
****************************************************)

open Hh_core

(**
 * Watches a repo and logs state-leave and state-enter
 * events on it using a Watchman subscription.
 *
 * This is useful to ask the question "is this repo mid-update
 * right now?", which isn't provided by the Mercurial or Watchman
 * APIs.
 *
 * Socket can be retrieved by invoking this command with --get-sockname
 *
 * Clients get the status by connecting to the socket and reading
 * newline-terminated messages. The message can be:
 *   'unknown' - watcher doesn't know what state the repo is in
 *   'mid_update' - repo is currently undergoing an update
 *   'settled' - repo is settled (not undergoing an update)
 *
 * After sending 'settled' message, the socket is closed.
 * An 'unknown' or 'mid_updat' message is eventually followed by a
 * 'settled' message when the repo is settled.
 *
 * The Hack Monitor uses the watcher when first starting up to delay
 * initialization while a repo is in the middle of an update. Initialization
 * mid-update is undesirable because the wrong saved state will be loaded
 * (the one corresponding to the revision we are leaving) resulting in
 * a slow recheck after init.
 *
 * Why do we need a socket with a 'settled' notification instead of just
 * having the Hack Server tail the watcher's logs? Consider the following
 * race:
   *
   * Watcher prints 'mid_update' to logs, Watchman has sent State_leave
   * event to subscribers before the Hack Monitor's subscription started,
   * and the Watcher crashes before processing this State_leave.
   *
 *
 * If the Hack Monitor just tailed the watcher logs to see the state of the
 * repo, it would not start a server, would never get the State_leave watchman
 * event on its subscription, and would just wait indefinitely.
 *
 * The watcher must also be used as the source-of-truth for the repo's
 * state during startup instead of the Hack Monitor's own subscription.
 * Consider the following incorrect usage of the Watcher:
   *
   * Hack Monitor starts up, starts a Watchman subscription, checks watcher
   * for repo state and sees 'mid_update', delays starting a server.
   * Waits on its Watchman subscription for a State_leave before starting a
   * server.
   *
 *
 * The Monitor could potentially wait forever in this scenario due to a
 * race condition - Watchman has already sent the State_leave to all
 * subscriptions before the Monitor's subscription was started, but it
 * was not yet processed by the Watcher.
 *
 * The Hack Monitor should instead be waiting for a 'settled' from the
 * Watcher.
