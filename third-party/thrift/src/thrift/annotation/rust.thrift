struct Adapter {
  // A fully qualified path to a struct that implements `fbthrift::adapter::ThriftTypeAdapter`.
  //
  // This will transform the type of this field to that struct's `AdaptedType`, and the corresponding
  // `ThriftTypeAdapter` methods will be called in the serialization and deserialization paths.
  //
  // Example:
  // If you have a Thrift struct like:
  // ```
  // struct Foo {
  //   @rust.Adapter{
  //    name = "fbthrift_adapters::DurationSecondsAdapter"
  //   }
  //   1: i64 duration_secs;
  // }
  // ```
  //
  // The generated Rust struct's `duration_secs` field will be set to the type
  // `<fbthrift_adapters::DurationSecondsAdapter as ::fbthrift::adapter::ThriftTypeAdapter>::AdaptedType`
  // (which is `std::time::Duration`) and marshalling the `i64` to and from `Duration` will be handled
  // in the serialization/deserialization path with the methods defined on the `ThriftTypeAdapter` impl.
  //
  // The name provided here must be a valid Rust path, i.e. the `fbthrift_adapters` crate must be added
  // to the Thrift library's `rust_deps`. Alternatively, you define the adapter in a file added to the
  // Thrift library's `rust_include_srcs`, and use the `crate::` prefix in your adapter name.
  //
  // If `<>` is present at the end of the name, we will treat the name as a generic and fill it in with
  // the original unadapted type.
  // For example:
  // ```
  // struct Foo {
  //   @rust.Adapter{
  //    name = "fbthrift_adapters::DurationSecondsAdapter<>"
  //   }
  //   1: i64 duration_secs;
  // }
  // ```
  // will use `fbthrift_adapters::DurationSecondsAdapter<i64>` as the adapter.
  //
  // If the adapter name starts with `crate::` and this `@rust.Adapter` is applied transitively with
  // @scope.Transitive, `crate::` will be replaced with the name of the crate in which the
  // transitive annotation is defined.
