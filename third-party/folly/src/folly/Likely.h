//  Useful when the author has better knowledge than the compiler of which code

//  overwhelmingly likely.

//  Notes:
//  * All supported compilers treat unconditionally-noreturn blocks as unlikely.
//    This is true for blocks which unconditionally throw exceptions and for
//    blocks which unconditionally call [[noreturn]]-annotated functions. Such
//    cases do not require likeliness annotations.
