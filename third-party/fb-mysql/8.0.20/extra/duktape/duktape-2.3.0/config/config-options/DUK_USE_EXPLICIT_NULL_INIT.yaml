  When zeroing structures, don't rely on memzero initializing pointers to
  NULL.  Instead, write NULL values explicitly after zeroing.  This should
  only be necessary when a NULL pointer is not represented by zero bytes in
  memory.

  # NOTE: Condition in Duktape 1.2 seems wrong, and is linked to packed tval.
