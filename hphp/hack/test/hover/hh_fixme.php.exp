HH_FIXME
---
`HH_FIXME[N]` disables type checker error N on the next line. It does
not change runtime behavior.

**`HH_FIXME` is almost always a bad idea**. You might get an
exception, or you might get an unexpected value. Even scarier, you
might cause an exception in a totally different part of the codebase.

```
/* HH_FIXME[4110] My reason here */
takes_num("x") + takes_num("y");
```

In this example, the type checker will accept the code, but the code
will still crash when you run it (`TypeHintViolationException` when
calling `takes_num`).

Note that `HH_FIXME` applies to all occurrences of the error on the
next line.

## You can fix it!

It is always possible to write code without `HH_FIXME`. This usually
requires changing type signatures and some refactoring. Your code will
be more reliable, the type checker can help you, and future changes
will be less scary.

See also `HH\FIXME\UNSAFE_CAST()`, which is still bad, but much more
precise.
