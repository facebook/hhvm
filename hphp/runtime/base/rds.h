/*
 * The RDS (Request Data Segment) is a region of memory quickly
 * accessible to each hhvm thread that is running a PHP request.
 *
 * Essentially this is a per-thread memory region, along with an
 * internal dynamic link table to give the segment the same layout for
 * each thread as new data is allocated.
 *
 * The RDS starts with a small header that is statically layed out,
 * followed by the main segment, which is initialized to zero at the
 * start of each request.  The next section, contains "persistent"
 * data, which is data that retains the same values across requests.
 *
 * The persistent segment is implemented       RDS Layout:
 * by mapping the same physical pages to
 * different virtual addresses, so they          +------------+ <-- tl_base
 * are all accessible from the                   |  Header    |
 * per-thread RDS base.  The normal              +------------+
 * region is perhaps analogous to .bss,          |            |
 * while the persistent region is                |  Normal    |
 * analagous to .rodata.                         |    region  |
 *                                               |            |
 * When we're running in C++, the base           +------------+
 * of RDS is available via a thread              | Persistent | higher
 * local exported from this module               |     region |   addresses
 * (tl_base).  When running in                   +------------+
 * JIT-compiled code, a machine register
 * is reserved to always point at the base of RDS.
 *
 *
 * Allocation/linking API:
 *
 *   You can allocate data from RDS in two primary ways, either by
 *   binding a Link, or anonymously.  The distinction is whether the
 *   allocated space is associated with some unique key that allows it
 *   to be re-found for any new attempts to allocate that symbol.
 *
 *   Anonymous allocations are created with RDS::alloc.  Non-anonymous
 *   allocations can be created in two ways:
 *
 *     RDS::bind(Symbol) uses an RDS-internal link table to find if
 *     there is an existing handle for the given symbol.
 *
 *     RDS::Link<T>::bind allows the caller to make use of the
 *     uniqueness of other runtime structure (e.g. the Class
 *     structure) to avoid having a special key and needing to do
 *     lookups in the internal RDS link table.  The "key" for the
 *     allocation is the RDS::Link<> object itself.
 *
 *   Finally, you can allocate anonymous single bits at a time with
 *   allocBit().
 *
