(* Given an AST for a block, compute (needs_local_this, decl_vars).
 * `needs_local_this` is true if the method must use InitThisLoc and reference
 * $this as a local.
 * `decl_vars` is the list of locals that must be emitted
 * in the .declvars declaration, as referenced or defined in the block,
 * in the order in which they appear.
 * Do not include function parameters or $GLOBALS. Include $this only if
 *    (a) it's not available implicitly because this is a function or static
 *        method (has_this=false)
 * or (b) this is a closure body (so is_closure_body=true)
 * or (c) it appears in a bare position as a function parameter.
