HHVM is an open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs written in [Hack](http://hacklang.org). HHVM uses a just-in-time (JIT) compilation approach to achieve superior performance while maintaining amazing development flexibility.

HHVM should be used together with a webserver like the built in, easy to deploy [Proxygen](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/basic-usage/proxygen), or a [FastCGI](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/advanced-usage/fastCGI)-based webserver on top of nginx or Apache.

## Installing

If you're new, try our [getting started guide](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/getting-started/getting-started).

You can install a [prebuilt package](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/installation/introduction#prebuilt-packages) or [compile from source](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/installation/building-from-source).

## Running

You can run standalone programs just by passing them to hhvm: `hhvm example.hack`.

If you want to host a website:
* Install your favorite webserver. [Proxygen](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/basic-usage/proxygen) is built into HHVM, fast and easy to deploy.
* Install our [package](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/installation/introduction#prebuilt-packages)
* Start your webserver
* Run `sudo /etc/init.d/hhvm start`
* Visit your site at `http://.../main.hack`

Our [getting started guide](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/getting-started/getting-started) provides a slightly more detailed introduction as well as links to more information.
