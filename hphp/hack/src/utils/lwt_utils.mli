(** Drop-in replacement for [Unix.select] that works even when the Lwt main loop
is running (i.e. your function has [Lwt_main.run] somewhere higher up in the
call stack).

The Lwt main loop is an event loop pumped by [Unix.select], and so regular
[Unix.select] calls are prone to raising `EINTR`. The implementation of this
function does not use [Unix.select] at all, but Lwt primitives that accomplish
the same thing.

There are several ways for it to be cancelled:
* [cancel] parameter
  e.g. `let (cancel, u) = Lwt.bind(); Lwt.wakeup_later u (); exec_checked ~cancel`
  Upon the cancel parameter being completed, we will send a SIGKILL to the underlying
  process. In Unix, this cannot be ignored nor blocked. It will result in
  Process_failure.status=WSIGNALED Sys.sigkill, and .stdout/.stderr will contain
  whatever the process had sent before that.
* [timeout] parameter
  e.g. `exec_checked ~timeout:30.0`
  This parameter is passed straight through to Lwt_process.open_process_full.
  Its behavior is to aggressively closes stdout/stderr pipes and also send a SIGKILL.
  It will result in Process_failure.status=WSIGNALED Sys.sigkill, and .stdout/.stderr
  will be empty because of the closed pipes, and .exn will likely be something about
  those closed pipes too.
* Lwt.cancel
  e.g. `Lwt.pick [exec_checked ...; Lwt.return_none]`.
  This has been deprecated as a cancellation mechanism by the Lwt folks.
  This will *NOT* kill the underlying process. It will close the pipes.
  As to what happens to the promise? you shouldn't really even be asking,
  and indeed varies depending on the process. *)
