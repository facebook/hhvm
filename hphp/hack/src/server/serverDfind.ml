(* dfind doesn't always pick up the token 
 * however, it seems that in some cases, despite the fact that the token was
 * not picked up, dfind is still healthy.
 * So here is our strategy:
 * 1) retry calling dfind
 * 2) every five times, retry calling dfind from scratch
 * 3) after 20 times, kill the server
 * It should make things a lot more resilient to failure, in the mean time
 * we will try to figure out what is going on.
