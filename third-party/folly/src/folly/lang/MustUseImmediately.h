// The `ext` namespace is not for end-users, but for library authors.

// expect to see churn on the API, and to be asked to help with changes.
namespace folly::ext {

// ## What are must-use-immediately types, and how should I handle them?
//
// Types satisfying the must-use-immediately concept follow these principles:
//  - The type is always immovable.
//  - APIs always take the type by-value, never by-reference.
//  - It typically supports the `unsafe_mover()` protocol, documented in detail
//    in the doc of the user-facing `must_use_immediately_unsafe_mover()`.
//
// Types usually need to become must-use-immediately because they contain
// references whose lifetime isn't safe enough for the context. Examples:
//
//  - In `folly/lang/bind/`, types often contain references to prvalues. Its
//    ad hoc reimplementation of must-use-immediately guarantees that refs
//    inside bindings remain valid. Future: Convert to `MustUseImmediately.h`.
//
//  - In `folly/coro`:
//      * Must-use-immediately coroutines (like `now_task`) let people
//        **safely** take args by-reference, which is otherwise unsafe.
//      * Types that contain refs with lifetime unknown, or too-short for safe
//        async usage will measure `safe_alias_of < closure_min_arg_safety`.
//      * Safe APIs (like pipelines and `then`) make types must-use-immediately
//        based on their `safe_alias` measurement, or the must-use-immediately
//        status of their parts.
//
// ## General protocol for creating must-use-immediately types
//
// To create a must-use-immediately type, either:
//
//   - If your type is movable and is OK to inherit from, then use
//     `wrap_must_use_immediately_t<YourBase>`. It automatically supplies an
//     `unsafe_mover()` implementation for the wrapped type.
//
//   - Derive `public must_use_immediately_crtp<YourType>`. In this case, you
//     will typically also want to implement the `unsafe_mover()` protocol. To
//     do so, read the ENTIRE doc of `must_use_immediately_unsafe_mover()`.
//     Especially: the notes on object slicing, and `noexcept` discipline. Then,
//     `curried_unsafe_mover_from_bases_and_members()` should be good enough.
//
// ## Handling must-use-immediately types in APIs
//
// APIs that work with must-use-immediately types must follow these rules:
//
// (1) Always take them by-value, never by-reference.
//
//     If your API must also support pass-by-reference for other types, then you
//     must bifurcate it on `must_use_immediately<T>` -- if `true`,
//     pass-by-value; if `false`, pass-by-reference.
//
// (2) NEVER expose non-static member functions for actions that consume the
//     must-use-immediately value -- `*this` is always by-reference.
//
//     INSTEAD: Use pass-by-value static member functions, or ADL CPOs.
//
// (3) Must-use-immediately types are immovable, but you may need to move them
//     internally in your API implementation.  For this, you can use the
//     callable from `must_use_immediately_unsafe_mover(std::move(t))`. For
//     example, you can pass `mover` into another coroutine, and then call
//     `mover()` to reconstitute the value.  The most typical pattern is to
//     forward a prvalue (by-value) argument by doing both on one line:
//     must_use_immediately_unsafe_mover(std::move(t))()
//
//     DANGER: DO NOT use this to move immovable types outside of your API,
//     where the lifetime safety was assured via pass-by-value (1) & (2).
//
// ## Case study: Must-use-immediately awaitables in `folly::coro`
//
// When `must_use_immediately_v<A> == true`, this indicates that the awaitable
// or semiawaitable `A` should be `co_await`ed in the full-expression that
// created it.  For an example, see `NowTask.h`.  Using immediate awaitables
// reduces the risk of lifetime bugs.
//
// To support rule (1), many coro APIs bifurcate on `must_use_immediately_v`.
// This is primarily done to support non-standard awaitables like `coro::Baton`,
// which must be awaited by-reference. The better solution would be to make
// `Baton::co_await()` return a must-use-immediately awaitable, and make most
// coro APIs take (semi)awaitables by-value.
//
// To support rule (2), we have been removing non-static member functions for
// actions that consume the (semi)awaitable.  For example:
//   - `task.scheduleOn()` was removed in favor of `co_withExecutor()`,
//   - `.start()` and `.semi()` are unsafe and omitted by `now_task`, etc.
//
// Caveat: If you encounter a public `folly::coro` API that does not yet handle
// must-use-immediately (semi)awaitables, and simply takes the input by `&&`,
// please fix it via one of these paths:
//   - If possible, switch it to only take (semi)awaitables by-value.
//   - If not, branch the API as in (1) above.
//   - Ask for help in the Coroutines group.
//
// ## Why do we need `folly_must_use_immediately_t` member type tags?
//
// Isn't immovability (and/or `unsafe_mover()`) enough?
//   - Not all must-use-immediately types have `unsafe_mover`.  In rare cases,
//     it is okay if the type cannot be moved.
//   - Some APIs, especially in `folly::coro`, must allow pass-by-reference. In
//     those cases, the API must bifurcate on `must_use_immediately_v` so that
//     use-immediately types are taken by value.
//   - Finally, the member-type-alias lets us add a (future) lint error whenever
//     an API takes a must-use-immediately arg, UNLESS it is marked with a
//     special `clang::annotate_type()` that excuses the bad behavior:
//     https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AttributeReference.html#annotate-type
//
// ## Why is the `unsafe_mover()` protocol required?
//
// Without prvalue-forwarding support in the language, it becomes impossible to
// write code like this:
//
//   auto compositeImmediate() { return combine(immediate1(), immediate2()); }
//
// The problem is that we cannot move `immediate1()` and `immediate2()` into any
// larger structure (they are immovable), but we also cannot take their
// references, since those become invalid upon `return`.
//
// In practice, it is essential to be able to write functions that compose
// must-use-immediately types, and we repeatedly found it necessary to add
// unsafe movers -- for coro (semi)awaitables, for bindings, and for pipelines.

//
// Wraps `T::unsafe_mover(must_use_immediately_private_t, T&&)` for immovable
// types that implement it. For movable types that don't support the protocol,
// falls back to `default_unsafe_mover_t`.
//
// ## Implementing `T::unsafe_mover(must_use_immediately_private_t, T&&)`
//
// Required semantics:
//
//  - `unsafe_mover` is a destructive operation on an immovable type.  Note:
//    `T&&` is an rvalue ref, not a forwarding one.  Do NOT support lval refs.
//  - It takes ownership of the internals of `T`, leaving it "moved out".
//  - It returns a mover value (never a reference), whose `operator() &&` is a
//    single-use operation returning a prvalue equivalent to the original `T`.
//  - Both construction and invocation of the returned mover are `noexcept`.
//
// Written without constraints, `Base::unsafe_mover()` will also be invocable on
// derived instances. This is occasionally desirable, but comes with a
// significant risk of object-slicing bugs (next section), so implementations
// should lock down the type of `T` as much as practical, via patterns like:
//
//   template <typename U, std::enable_if_t<std::is_same_v<U, T>, int> = 0>
//   static auto unsafe_mover(must_use_immediately_private_t, U&&);
//
// ### A note on object slicing when inheriting from must-use-immediately types
//
// All `unsafe_mover` implementations work by moving out the constituent parts
// of the immovable type. Since parts can be must-use-immediately / immovable,
// we'll usually call `must_use_immediately_unsafe_mover()` on each one.
//
// An object slicing problem will occur whenever `Base::unsafe_mover` is called
// on a `Derived` class with one of these properties:
//
// (a) It adds a new member variable, or new base with member variables. Then,
//     `Base::unsafe_mover` wouldn't know about the new data and discard it.
//
// (b) It adds new side effects to destruction, move, copy, or assignment. Then,
//     the `unsafe_mover()`'s wrapping/unwrapping will cause the custom logic to
//     run at an unexpected time.
//
// Such `Derived` types MUST customize `unsafe_mover` to return a custom mover
// that accounts for the slicing-unfriendly behaviors (a) or (b).
//
// Some slicing-prevention strategies:
//   - Prefer composition (`Inner inner_;`) over inheritance.
//   - Prevent `Base::unsafe_mover()` from being used with derived classes via
//     constraints (example above), by marking the class `final`, or both.
//   - If you must allow derived classes, then either use
//     `curried_unsafe_mover_from_bases_and_members()`, which implements a
//     `sizeof()`-based slicing detection heuristic, or (last resort) review its
//     comments & implement your own.
//   - Test, test, test: Whenever you derive from a must-use-immediately class,
//     round-trip it via an unsafe mover and confirm it works as desired.
//
// There is no silver bullet. For example, comparing `sizeof()` can have
// false-positives (e.g. adding virtual inheritance) and false-negatives (side
// effects in dtor / move / etc). When inheriting from must-use-immediately,
// request thoughtful code review, and leave comments pointing at this doc for
// the next person to touch your code.
//
// ## A note on `noexcept` discipline
//
// This implementation `static_assert`s that constructing **and** using a mover
// is `noexcept`. Internally, movers implementations must not neglect to test
// their own operations via `noexcept()` expressions.
//
// In the future this current API could be relaxed to `noexcept(noexcept(...))`,
// but none of the current use-cases SHOULD have throwing move ctors
// (`folly::bind` bindings, `folly::coro` awaitables, `folly::coro` pipelines).
//
// In the unlikely event we make this change, we'd have to add a new
// `static_assert` in every place that uses `must_use_immediately_unsafe_mover`
// to make sure it's still `noexcept` in that usage ...  or just fix it up.
//
// So, this is an expensive, breaking change.  But, it is probably not worth it
// to forward-engineer this, and all its current consumers, to use
// `noexcept(noexcept())` for the sake of a use-case that may never come.
//
// ### Why is `unsafe_mover` a static method?
//
// This has two outcomes:
//   - Each `unsafe_mover` can explicitly decide whether to accept subclasses.
//     As discussed above, this helps types manage object slicing risk.
//   - Unimportantly, writing `T::unsafe_mover` **below** is a cheap syntax-only
//     way of ensuring that `T&&` is NOT a forwarding ref, but an rvalue ref.
