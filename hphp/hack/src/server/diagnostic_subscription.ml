   * during declaration of A. But the error itself can be reported in completely
   * different file (like As parent C).
   *
   * Things like IDE don't want this mapping - when asking about A they want to
   * get all errors REPORTED, not GENERATED in A. local_errors maintains reverse
   * mapping from files with reported errors to files that cause them to be
   * reported, i.e A -> [A, C] means that A is a file that IDE cares about and
   * to get its error list we need to analyse A and C.
   *
   * To keep things responsive, we'll keep
   *
   * |local_errors| < max (errors_limit , |priority_files| + |pushed_errors|)
   *
   * i.e we always report things in priority_files, and if we reported some
   * errors in a file, we'll keep them fresh until they are fixed. If after
   * that we still report errors in less than errors_limit files, we'll "top up"
   * with errors from some arbitrary files *)
