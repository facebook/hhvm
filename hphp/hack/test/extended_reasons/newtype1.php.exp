error: Typing[4110] Invalid argument

File newtype1.php--file2.php, line 8, character 22 - line 8, character 23:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function pass_my_int(myint $y) : bool {
 8 |   return expect_bool(»$y«);
 9 | }

Expected bool

File newtype1.php--file2.php, line 3, character 22 - line 3, character 25:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | function expect_bool(»bool« $x): bool {
 4 |   return $x;
 5 | }

But got int

File newtype1.php--file1.php, line 3, character 18 - line 3, character 20:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | newtype myint as »int« = int;

Here's why:


  Step 1 of 3                                                      

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this function or method declaration

File newtype1.php--file2.php, line 3, character 10 - line 3, character 20:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | function »expect_bool«(bool $x): bool {
 4 |   return $x;
 5 | }

The supertype comes from this expression

File newtype1.php--file2.php, line 8, character 10 - line 8, character 24:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function pass_my_int(myint $y) : bool {
 8 |   return »expect_bool($y)«;
 9 | }


  Step 2 of 3                                                      

These are function types so next I checked the 1st function parameters.
Functions are contravariant in their parameters so the direction of the subtype relationship is reversed.

The subtype comes from this hint

File newtype1.php--file2.php, line 7, character 22 - line 7, character 26:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function pass_my_int(»myint« $y) : bool {
 8 |   return expect_bool($y);
 9 | }

which is defined here

File newtype1.php--file1.php, line 3, character 24 - line 3, character 26:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | newtype myint as int = »int«;

and flows into this expression

File newtype1.php--file2.php, line 7, character 28 - line 7, character 29:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function pass_my_int(myint »$y«) : bool {
 8 |   return expect_bool($y);
 9 | }

as the parameter hint

which itself flows into this expression

File newtype1.php--file2.php, line 8, character 22 - line 8, character 23:

 5 | }
 6 | 
 7 | function pass_my_int(myint $y) : bool {
 8 |   return expect_bool(»$y«);
 9 | }

as the type of the local variable

The supertype comes from this hint

File newtype1.php--file2.php, line 3, character 22 - line 3, character 25:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | function expect_bool(»bool« $x): bool {
 4 |   return $x;
 5 | }


  Step 3 of 3                    (here is where the error occurred) 

The subtype declares an upper bound so next I checked that was a subtype of the supertype.

The subtype comes from this hint

File newtype1.php--file1.php, line 3, character 18 - line 3, character 20:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | newtype myint as »int« = int;

The supertype is the same as before.

File newtype1.php--file2.php, line 3, character 22 - line 3, character 25:

 1 | <?hh
 2 | 
 3 | function expect_bool(»bool« $x): bool {
 4 |   return $x;
 5 | }
