;
; This helper routine is written in assembly to take care of the details
; when transferring control between jitted code and the translator.
;
; Note that this is only used when compiling under MSVC. The .S version
; of this file is used by everything else.
;
; The columns are registers of Linux and Mac ABI / Windows ABI / ARM ABI.

  ; instruction, so if we enter it with a jmp, that will unbalance the RSB and
  ; cause tons of branch mispredictions in the frames above us. To avoid this,
  ; we get to the prologue by calling a stub that pops the return address
  ; pushed by the call and jumps to the prologue. This pushes a bogus address
  ; on the RSB but the ret to callToExit always mispredicts anyway, and this
  ; keeps the RSB balanced.
