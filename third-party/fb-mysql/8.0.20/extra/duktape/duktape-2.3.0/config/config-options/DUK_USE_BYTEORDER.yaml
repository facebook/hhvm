  Byte order for platform: 1 = little endian, 2 = mixed (arm hybrid) endian,
  3 = big endian.

  ARM mixed endian means integers are little endian but IEEE doubles have
  mixed endianness: big endian bytes 12345678 are ordered in memory as
  43218765.

  (This define should be produced by duk_config.h; currently Duktape internals
  use automatically derived defines DUK_USE_{INTEGER,DOUBLE}_{LE,BE_ME}
  instead of using this define directly.)
