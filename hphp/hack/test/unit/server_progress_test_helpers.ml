(** Reading from ShowProgressLwt.watch_errors_file is inherently racey:
our test might insert an item into the errors file, but there'll be some time
before the disk change is reflected as an item in the Lwt_stream.
This function will wait up to 10 seconds for something to appear.

For convenience, this function flattens all results into a string:
* if nothing has appeared on the stream by the timeout, return the string "nothing"
* if the stream has been closed by the timeout, return the string "closed"
* if an item appeared on the stream by the timeout, return the string from the callback (f item)
