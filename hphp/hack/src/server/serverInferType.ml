(** Return the type of the smallest expression node whose associated span
 * (the Pos.t in its Tast.ExprAnnotation.t) contains the given position.
 * "Smallest" here refers to the size of the node's associated span, in terms of
 * its byte length in the original source file.
 *
 * If there is no single smallest node (i.e., multiple expression nodes have
 * spans of the same length containing the given position, where that length is
 * less than the length of all other spans containing the given position),
 * return the type of the first of these nodes visited in a preorder traversal
 * of the Tast.
 *
 * This choice is somewhat arbitrary, and would seem to be unnecessary at first
 * blush (and indeed would be in a concrete syntax tree). In most situations,
 * each expression should have a distinct span, but consider a sugar
 * pseudofunction `log_arraykey` which is desugared as follows:
 *
 * log_arraykey($ak);
 * // desugars to:
 * if (is_int($ak)) { log_int($ak); }
 * if (is_string($ak)) { log_string($ak); }
 *
 * In this situation, four expressions in the TAST have an equivalent span
 * referring to the span of `$ak` in the original source. We return the type of
 * the first visited in a preorder traversal, the argument to `is_int`. This
 * expression will have the expected type (i.e., the type of `$ak` before it is
 * refined by `is_int` or `is_string` in desugared code).
 *
 * Multiple expressions could also be associated with the same span if we
 * introduced a purely-logical expression to the TAST, which had no syntactical
 * representation (i.e., it contained a single child: another expression with
 * the same associated span).
 *
 * The choice of returning the "smallest" expression is as a proxy for concrete
 * syntax specificity, where a child node (in the concrete syntax tree) is
 * considered more specific than its parent. We would like to return the type of
 * the most specific expression node containing the given position, but we
 * cannot assume that the structure of the CST is reflected in the TAST.
