/** Creates a new temporary file, without automatic cleanup.
 *
 * `File\temporary_file()` is **strongly** recommended instead.
 *
 * - If the prefix starts with `.`, it is interpreted relative to the current
 *   working directory.
 * - If the prefix starts with `/`, it is treated as an absolute path.
 * - Otherwise, it is created in the system temporary directory.
 *
 * Regardless of the kind of prefix, the parent directory must exist.
 *
 * A suffix can optionally be provided; this is useful when you need a
 * particular filename extension; for example,
 * `File\temporary_file('foo', '.txt')` may create `/tmp/foo123456.txt`.
 *
 * The temporary file:
 * - will be a new file (i.e. `O_CREAT | O_EXCL`)
 * - be owned by the current user
 * - be created with mode 0600
 * - **will not** be automatically deleted
