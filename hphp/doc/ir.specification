* HipHop Intermediate Representation (HHIR)
*******************************************



Introduction
------------

The HipHop Intermediate Representation (IR) is a typed, in-memory,
static-single-assignment, intermediate-level representation of HHBC programs
used for just in time compilation, with these goals:

  1. Complete. The IR represents a program or program fragment entirely,
     without reference to HHBC or other upstream forms of the program.

  2. Type-Safe. Since the IR deals directly with refined types and internal VM
     types, all operations are typesafe. All instruction parameters have a
     parameter type P, and all variables have a type S. Given an instruction
     with source parameter type P and variable type S, S must be equal to or
     more refined than P (S == P or S <: P).

  3. Machine Independent. Since this IR is intended to be used in a JIT
     compiler, it will always be used in a machine specific context.
     Nevertheless, we rely on machine independence in order to separate
     concerns and increase portability of the VM. Passes which manipulate IR
     based on PHP or HHBC semantics should be portable. Passes which deal with
     machine specifics (such as register allocation) should be done in the
     lower level IR (vasm). Types are machine independent.

The unit of compilation is the IRUnit, which is a collection of Blocks
containing IRInstructions that produce and consume SSATmp values. Blocks are
single-entry, single-exit sequences of instructions (i.e. basic
blocks). Instructions may be annotated with Type parameter which modifies the
instruction's behavior, or with additional compile-time constant data (see
extra-data.h). Each SSATmp has a Type which describes the set of values it may
hold, over its entire live range. Instructions may have side effects, which
occur in execution order.

The static single assignment form guarantees the following two invariants for a
well-formed compilation unit:

  1. Each SSATmp is assigned to by exactly one IRInstruction.

  2. Definitions dominate uses. Every path to an IRInstruction using an SSATmp
     first executes the IRInstruction defining the SSATmp.

Any pass that generates or manipulates IR must preserve these invariants,
however it is possible and expected for the invariants to be temporarily broken
during IR generation or during an optimization pass.


Control Flow
------------

IRUnits have one entry block, zero or more exit blocks, and zero or more catch
blocks. Exit blocks leave the compilation unit in the middle of the same PHP
function using one of several instructions that exit a compilation unit
(e.g. ReqBindJmp). Catch blocks are blocks that are reachable from exceptional
control flow edges, and are executed during unwinding if an exception
propagates through the instruction that had it as a `taken' edge.

No SSATmps are defined on entry to the main Block.

Blocks which are join points may start with a DefLabel with destination
SSATmps. In that case, each predecessor must be a Jmp passing a matching number
of sources. In this case the Jmp acts as a tail-call, passing arguments the
same way a plain call would.

Together, the sources of the Jmp instructions and the destinations of the
DefLabel instructions act as traditional SSA Phi pseudo-functions; The type of
the DefLabel's destination is the type-union of the corresponding sources.
Because the Jmp sources are at the ends of blocks, they do not violate the SSA
dominator rule (rule 2, above).


Types
-----

For an overview of the HHIR type system, see the "Type System" section in
hackers-guide/jit-core.md.


SSATmps
-------

An SSATmp represents a virtual register. Since HHIR uses SSA, an SSATmp may
only be assigned to by one instruction. The type of an SSATmp represents the
set of values it may hold at the point it is defined, which is invariant over
the lifetime of the variable (from the definition point to the last use).


IRInstructions
--------------

An instruction is an executable operation with zero or more inputs (sources),
zero or one result (destination), and possible side effects such as accessing
memory, doing I/O, and which may branch or throw an exception. Some
instructions have a Type parameter which modifies its behavior, or other "extra
data" in an arbitrary C++ struct (see extra-data.h).

Each instruction has a signature which describes its effect, parameter types,
and return type, for example:

  IsType<T>, D(Bool), S(Cell), NF

The first column is the instruction name (and optional Type parameter in <>).

The second column describes the result (destination) using one of the D*
macros documented in hphp/runtime/vm/jit/ir-opcode.h, or ND for no destination.

The third column describes the sources, separated by whitespace, using macros
documented in hphp/runtime/vm/jit/ir-opcode.h, or NA if there are no sources.

The fourth column contains the flags, described below. The short name of the
flag (used in this file) is given first, with the long name that it expands to
in hphp/runtime/vm/jit/ir-opcode.cpp in parentheses after it.

NF

  The instruction has no flags.

PRc (ProducesRC)

  The instruction produces a value with an unconsumed reference that must be
  consumed, either by DecRefing it or storing it somewhere in memory.

CRc (ConsumesRC)

  The instruction consumes a reference to one or more of its sources, either by
  decreasing its refcount or storing the reference to memory.

T (Terminal)

  The instruction has no next instruction; it either jumps, returns, or throws.

B (Branch)

  The instruction has a (sometimes optional) taken edge. Instructions that are
  conditional branches (i.e. a Branch that is not Terminal) will also have a
  next edge.

P (Passthrough)

  The value of the instruction's dest is the same as one of its inputs; it
  differs only in the type of the variable, or some other property that doesn't
  affect the value of the variable itself.

MProp (MInstrProp)

  The instruction may affect the type and/or value of its base operand,
  operating on object properties.

MElem (MInstrElem)

  The instruction may affect the type and/or value of its base operand,
  operating on array elements.


Instruction set
---------------

1. Checks and Asserts

Note: Instructions that check boxed types only check that the operand is boxed,
and they ignore the type of the value inside the box (the inner type). The
inner type is normally checked when the value within the box is about to be
loaded, using a separate CheckRefInner instruction.

| CheckType<T>, DRefineS(0), S(Gen,Cls), B|P

  Check that the type of the src S0 is T, and if so copy it to D, and
  fallthrough. If S0 cannot be proven to be T, branch to block B. Note that
  this means S0 still /may/ be a subtype of T in block B in some circumstances.

  Specifically, subtypes of Type::Static may not be checked precisely,
  depending on the type of the source.  This means the instruction may take the
  branch in some circumstances even when S0 is a subtype of T, if T has a
  non-empty intersection with Type::Static.

  Also note that many types are not supported as the typeParam right now.

| CheckNullptr, ND, S(StaticStr,Nullptr), B

  If S0 is not a null pointer, branch to block B. This is used to check the
  return value of a native helper that returns a potentially null StringData*.

| AssertType, DRefineS(0), S(Gen,Cls,Ctx), P

  Assert that the type of S0 is T, copying it to D.

| CheckTypeMem<T>, ND, S(MemToGen), B

  If the value pointed to by S0 is not type T, branch to the block B.

| CheckVArray, DArrPacked, S(Arr), B|P

  Check that S0 is a varray, and if so copy it to D, and fallthrough. If S0 is
  not a varray, branch to block B.

| CheckDArray, DArrMixed, S(Arr), B|P

  Check that S0 is a darray, and if so copy it to D, and fallthrough. If S0 is
  not a darray, branch to block B.

| HintLocInner<T,localId>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Hint that the inner type of a BoxedCell in localId is likely type T, where T
  is a subtype of BoxedCell. The type must be guarded on before it is known to
  be true (via CheckRefInner).

| HintStkInner<T,offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  Hint that the inner type of the BoxedInitCell on the stack pointed to by S0
  at offset (in cells) is T. The type must be guarded on before it is known to
  be true (via CheckRefInner).

| HintMBaseInner<T>, ND, NA, NF

  Hint that the inner type of the BoxedInitCell pointed to by the member base
  register is T.  The type must be guarded on before it is known to be true
  (via CheckRefInner).

| CheckLoc<T,localId>, ND, S(FramePtr), B

  Check that type of the given localId on the frame S0 is T; if not, branch to
  block B.

| CheckStk<T,offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), B

  Check that the type of the cell on the stack pointed to by S0 at offset (in
  cells) is T; if not, branch to block B.

| CheckMBase<T>, ND, S(LvalToGen), B

  Check that the value pointed to by the member base register S0 has type T; if
  not, branch to block B.  This is functionally the same as CheckTypeMem.

| AssertLoc<T,localId>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Asserts that type of the supplied local on the frame S0 is T. This is used
  for local type information, and is similar to CheckLoc except it doesn't
  imply a runtime check (the assertion must've already been proven to be true)
  and cannot cause control flow.

| AssertStk<T,offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  Assert that stack element at `offset' (in cells) from S0 has type T. This is
  similar to a CheckStk except that it does not imply a runtime check and
  cannot cause control flow.

| AssertMBase<T>, ND, NA, NF

  Assert that the value pointed to by the member base register has type T.
  This is similar to a CheckMBase except that it does not imply a runtime check
  and cannot cause control flow.

| CastStk<T,offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  Cast the stack element at `offset' (in cells) from S0 to type T.

| CastMem<T>, ND, S(PtrToGen), NF

  Cast the TypedValue at S0 to type T.

The following instructions deal with parameter coercion (the standard type
conversion for arguments to HNI functions). If parameter coercion fails these
functions will throw a TVCoercion exception. They may throw other types of
exceptions depending on how coercion is implemented.

| CoerceStk<T,offset,fn,argNum>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  Converts the stack slot at offset (in cells) to type T, with the semantics
  needed for calling a builtin function. May throw a TVCoercionException in the
  case of failed parameter coercion. The callee is f, and the position of the
  argument being coerced is argNum.

| CoerceMem<T,fn,argNum>, ND, S(PtrToGen), NF

  Coerces the TypedValue at S0 to type T, with the semantics
  needed for calling a builtin function. May throw a TVCoercionException in the
  case of failed parameter coercion. The callee is fn, and the position of the
  argument being coerced is argNum.

| CoerceCellToBool<fn,argNum>, D(Bool), S(Cell), NF

| CoerceCellToInt<fn,argNum>,  D(Int), S(Cell), NF

| CoerceStrToInt<fn,argNum>,   D(Int), S(Str), NF

| CoerceCellToDbl<fn,argNum>,  D(Dbl), S(Cell), NF

| CoerceStrToDbl<fn,argNum>,   D(Dbl), S(Str), NF

  These instructions convert either a Cell or a Str to a primitive type (Bool,
  Int, Dbl) and return the resulting value. They may throw an exception upon
  failed type coercion. They are encoded along with callee Func, fn, and the
  integer position of the argument, argNum, being coerced.

| CheckInit, ND, S(Gen), B

  If S0's type is Uninit, branch to block B.

| CheckInitMem, ND, S(MemToGen), B

  If the value pointed to by S0 has type Uninit, branch to block B.

| CheckCold<TransID>, ND, NA, B

  Check if the counter associated with translation TransID is cold (i.e. within
  a fixed threshold). If it's not (i.e. such translation has reached the
  "hotness threshold"), then branch to block B.

| CheckRefs<firstBit,mask,vals>, ND, S(Func) S(Int), B

  Perform reffiness guard checks. Operands:

    S0 - function pointer for the frame
    S1 - num params expected in the func
    firstBit - first bit to check, must be a multiple of 64
    mask - mask to check (RefDeps::Record::m_mask entries)
    vals - values to check (RefDeps::Record::m_vals entries)

  If any of the checks fail, branch to block B.

| EndGuards, ND, NA, NF

  A no-op at runtime, this instruction serves to mark the end of the initial
  sequence of guards in a trace.

| CheckNonNull, DSubtract(0, Nullptr), S(Nullptr,Func,PtrToGen,TCA,Cls,Ctx,Str), B

  If the value in S0 is Nullptr, branch to block B. If S0 cannot be Nullptr, or
  always is Nullptr, this check may be optimized away.

| AssertNonNull, DSubtract(0, Nullptr), S(Nullptr,StaticStr,Func,ArrLike), P

  Returns S0, with Nullptr removed from its type. This instruction currently
  supports a very limited range of types but can be expanded if needed.

| AssertARFunc<spOff>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(Func), NF

  Asserts that the ActRec at offset spOff from S0 contains function S1.

| AndInt, D(Int), S(Int) S(Int), NF

| OrInt, D(Int), S(Int) S(Int), NF

| XorInt, D(Int), S(Int) S(Int), NF

| Shl, D(Int), S(Int) S(Int), NF

| Shr, D(Int), S(Int) S(Int), NF

| Lshr, D(Int), S(Int) S(Int), NF

  Double arithmetic, integer arithmetic, and integer bitwise operations.
  Performs the operation described by the opcode name on S0 and S1, and puts
  the result in D.

  Undefined behavior occurs if Mod is given a divisor of zero, or if the
  divisor is -1 and the dividend is the minimum representable integer.

  AbsDbl computes the absolute value of a double-precision value.

  DivDbl conforms to IEEE 754. In particular, division by zero returns +/- INF
  or NAN depending on the dividend; and should the result of a division be zero
  the sign will follow the normal sign rules for division.

  DivInt will perform integer division of S1 by S0. S0 should not be zero and
  must divide S1.

  Note that Shr is an arithmetic right shift: The MSB is sign-extended.

  Lshr is logical right shift.

  Floor and Ceil will return an integral value not greater, or not less
  than their input respectively. Their use requires SSE 4.1, availability
  should be checked before they are emitted.

  AddIntO, SubIntO, MulIntO perform integer arithmetic on S0 and S1, but will
  branch to block B on integer overflow.

| XorBool, D(Bool), S(Bool) S(Bool), NF

  Logical XOR of the two sources. (Note that && and || do not have
  corresponding opcodes because they're handled at the bytecode level, to
  implement short-circuiting.)

| Mod, D(Int), S(Int) S(Int), NF

  Compute S0 mod S1. If S1 is -1 or 0 the results are undefined.

  offset given by S0 and offset. If size > 1, combine the type structures on
  the stack into the first one's denoted holes. Returns a copy.
  S1 is the calling class, used to resolve the this typehint.
  If isOrAsOp is set, raises an error if S0 contains traits, function types or
  typevars.
  If there is an error during type structure resolution, this instruction raises
  an error. If suppress is set, this error is demoted to a warning.

  Surprise flag hook for suspending eagerly executing async generators. The S0
  frame has an associated AG, which is already linked to the newly constructed
  AGWH in the blocked state. Decrefs S1 if it throws an exception.

  Surprise flag hook for suspending async functions and async generators resumed
  at Await. The S0 frame has an associated AFWH/AGWH still in the running state,
  S1 points to the child WH we are going to block on.

| SuspendHookCreateCont, ND, S(FramePtr) S(FramePtr) S(Obj), NF

| Unreachable<AssertReason>, ND, NA, T

  Indicates an unreachable code path. Any instructions that are post-dominated
  by an Unreachable may be treated as unreachable by the optimizer, and the
  behavior of a program that attempts to execute an Unreachable is undefined.

| EndBlock<AssertReason>, ND, NA, T

  Halt execution, without implying anything about the reachability of
  instructions preceding this. Intended for use in internal tests or other code
  not meant to be executed.

  Unconditional jump to block B. In the second form, the target block must
  start with a DefLabel with the same number of destinations as Jmp's number of
  sources. Jmp parallel-copies its sources to the DefLabel destinations.

| DefLabel, DMulti, NA, NF

  DefLabel defines variables received from a previous Jmp. A DefLabel with zero
  destinations is a no-op, and the predecessor blocks may not necessarily end
  in Jmp. A DefLabel with one or more destinations may only be reached by a Jmp
  instruction with the same number of sources. Ordinary branch instructions may
  not pass values to a DefLabel.

| Select, DUnion(1,2), S(Bool,Int) S(Top) S(Top), NF

  local's type is a subtype of T. If the local's type is not a subtype of T,
  then the load does not happen, and this instruction branches to B. This
  instruction is used for loading locals in pseudo-mains, where they can alias
  globals.

  CheckRefInner).

| LdCtx, DCtx, S(FramePtr), NF

  Loads into D the value of the m_this/m_cls field out of the frame pointer S0,
  which must be a frame for the function in the LdCtx's marker. The result
  could be either an object representing the this pointer or a class context.

| LdCctx, DCtx, S(FramePtr), NF

  rules about the relative positions of LdClosure and InitCtx instructions.

| CheckCtxThis, ND, S(Ctx), B

  the DefConst instruction will not actually appear in the IR instruction
  stream.

| Conjure<T>, DParam(Top), NA, NF

  be used in tests or code that is known to be unreachable.

| ConjureUse, ND, S(Gen), NF

  Define a "use" of S0 effectively keeping the value alive. As with Conjure it
  should not appear in reachable code.

| LdCls, D(Cls), S(Str) C(Cls), NF

  Loads the class named S0 in the context of the class S1. Invokes autoload and
  may raise an error if the class is not defined. The explicit context
  parameter allows the compiler to simplify this instruction to a DefConst in
  some cases. If S0 is constant, this instruction may be simplified to a
  LdClsCached.

  Loads the class named S0 via the RDS. Invokes autoload and may raise an error
  if the class is not defined.

  RDS. If not initialized, branch to B.

| LdSubClsCns<constantName,slot>, D(PtrToGen), S(Cls), NF

  Load the address of the constant 'constantName' for the class S0. The
  constant is known to be in the given slot. If the returned TypedValue is not

  Loads the target cache entry for a forwarding call to clsName::methodName.
  If the method does not exist, or the cache hasn't been filled yet, branch to
  B.

|    D(Func|Nullptr), C(Cls) S(FramePtr),
|    NF

  Lookup clsName::methodName in the forwarding class method cache. S0 should be
  the Class named by clsName and S1 should be the current vm frame pointer. May
  return Nullptr if lookup fails using a subset of the required lookup paths,
  indicating that a more complete lookup path should be taken. May throw if the
  method does not exist.

| CheckFuncStatic, ND, S(Func), B

  Tests to see if Func::m_attrs & AttrStatic, and if so branch to B.
  This instruction is intended to be used in forwarding calls, where we know
  that Func is not a closure.

  name are clsName and methodName, respectively. S0 is the current vm frame
  pointer. Returns Nullptr if the method cannot be found using a subset of the

|                      NF

  Loads a pointer to a static class property. S0 points to the class, S1 is the
  property name, and S2 is the class representing the context of the code

  to the object's class, S1 has the pre-live activation record at `offset'.
  Caches the mapping in the target cache. If `fatal' is true, raises a fatal if
  the class does not have an accessible method with the given name and does not
  have a __call method; otherwise (if `fatal' is false), raises a warning and
  puts func that does nothing and returns null (SystemLib::s_nullFunc) on the

  not defined yet. Fatal if function autoloader fails to define it.

| LookupFuncCached<funcName>, D(Func), NA, NF

  Loads the Func whose name is given from %1, invoking autoload if it is not
  defined yet. Fatal if the function autoload fails to define it. This
  instruction does not assume the loaded function will be called immediately,
  so it will raise a resolution failure error instead of a call failure error.

| LdFuncCachedU<funcName,fallbackName>, D(Func), NA, NF

  Try to load a Func named funcName from the RDS, if it isn't defined, try to
  load a Func named fallbackName. If that also isn't defined, invoke autoload.

  Allocate an object by cloning S0.

| NewClsMeth, D(ClsMeth), S(Cls) S(Func), NF

  Allocate a new ClsMethDataRef.

9. Call & Return

| SpillFrame<offset,numArgs>,
|   ND,
|   S(StkPtr) S(Func,Nullptr) S(Ctx,Cls,Nullptr) S(Str,Nullptr) S(Bool),
|   NF

  Operands:

     S0 - caller stack pointer
     S1 - callee Func or nullptr
     S2 - object (for FPushObjMethod*), class (for FPushClsMethod*), context
          (for FPushClsMethodF), or nullptr (for FPushFunc*).
     S3 - invoke name for magic dispatch
     S4 - whether this is a "dynamic" call

  Defines the fields for an activation record and writes them to the stack
  pointed to by S0, at `offset'.

| BeginInlining<offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  Marks the start of an inlined function whose stack resides offset cells below
  the SP. It has no effect other than to hint to optimization passes that at the
  start of the inlined function its stack is dead.

| DefInlineFP<func,callBCOff,retSPOff>, D(FramePtr),
|                                       S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr),
|                                       NF

  Defines a frame pointer for an inlined function.

  `func' is the function being inlined. `callBCOff' points to the caller's
  FCall instruction, `retSPOff' represents what the stack offset should be
  after the FCall instruction in the caller.

  This instruction is primarily used to represent a frame in the IR in a way
  that allows us to eliminate it entirely. When it cannot be eliminated (or if
  it is pushed into an unlikely path) it performs callee-side responsibilities
  for setting up an activation record (i.e. setting the return ip and m_callOff,
  storing the frame pointer into D).

  The caller frame pointer is passed as S1. This is used to keep track of the
  call chain of inlined functions for simplification and dead code elimination.

| InlineReturn<callerFPOff>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Unlinks a frame constructed by DefInlineFP.  `callerFPOff' is the offset of
  the caller's frame pointer relative to S0. Every inline region must contain
  exactly one InlineReturn or InlineReturnNoFrame. Optimization passes which
  attempt to elide DefInlineFP detect "main" blocks within an inlined region as
  those which are dominated by BeginInlining and post-dominated by InlineReturn.

| InlineSuspend<callerFPOff>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Identical to an InlineReturn, but for use when the frame is being suspended in
  a side exit and will be torn down via an InlineReturn in the main trace. The
  behavior of InlineSuspend is identical to inline return, but it allows us to
  preserve the invariant that an inline region has a single InlineReturn for
  every DefInlineFP (while still allowing InlineSuspend in the case of a side
  exit).

| InlineReturnNoFrame<InlineFrameStart>, ND, NA, NF

  Mark the end of an inlined function for which no DefInlineFP was required. The
  primary purpose of this instruction is to mark the result of a SpillFrame as
  dead. InlineFrameStart is the caller FP-relative offset of the start of the
  callee frame. Everything below InlineFrameStart is dead.

| CallUnpack<spOffset,numParams,callOff,funcd,destroyLocals>,
|                       DCall,
|                       S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr),
|                       NF

  Invoke function corresponding to the current FPI with numParams arguments,
  the last of which is an array of the remaining args. Used for FCall with
  unpack. S0+spOffset points to the stack resulting after the ActRec for the
  function and numParams arguments have been pushed. CallUnpack pops the array
  off the stack, pushes the elements of the array as arguments, and invokes the
  function in the ActRec.

| SyncReturnBC<spOffset,callBCOffset>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), NF

  Stores callBCOffset into the frame at spOffset from S0 as the call bytecode
  address and the frame S1 as the return frame.

| Call<offset,numParams,callOff,funcd,destroyLocals>, DCall,
|                                                     S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr),
|                                                     NF

  Transfer control to a callee, based on the pre-live activation record and set
  of args on the stack pointed to by S0 at `offset'. S1 is the current caller
  frame pointer. The `funcd' in the extra data is a Func* for the callee if we
  know the callee statically.

| NativeImpl<func>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(StkPtr), NF

  Execute a call to the native builtin specified by the current function. S0
  and S1 should be the current vmfp and vmsp, respectively.

| CallBuiltin, DBuiltin, S(FramePtr) S(StkPtr) SVar(PtrToGen,Gen,Cls,Nullptr), PRc

  Call builtin function with N arguments. S0 and S1 should be the current vmfp
  and vmsp, respectively.

  The source and destination types correspond to C++ parameter and return types
  as follows:

    C++ type            HHIR type         Position
    -----------------   ---------         --------
    bool                Bool              source, destination
    int64_t             Int               source, destination
    double              Dbl               source, destination
    const String&       PtrToStr          source
    const Array&        PtrToArr          source
    const Object&       PtrToObj          source
    const Variant&      PtrToGen          source
    Variant&            PtrToGen          source (ref param)
    String              {Str|InitNull}    destination
    Array               {Arr|InitNull}    destination
    Object              {Obj|InitNull}    destination
    Variant             {Gen-UninitNull}  destination

| RetCtrl<spOff,suspendingResumed>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr) S(Gen), T

  Ensure that S0 + `spOff' (in cells) is stored in rvmsp and that S1's saved
  frame pointer is stored in rvmfp, then return to the saved return address in
  S1.  The return value is S2, which is passed via the rret_*() registers to
  the caller.  The `suspendingResumed' flag indicates when this instruction is
  suspending a resumable rather than performing a normal function return.

| AsyncFuncRet<spOff>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr) S(Cell), T

  Return from a resumed async function, assuming no surprise. Ensures that
  S0 + `spOff` (in cells) is stored in rvmsp and that S1 is stored in rvmfp,
  packs return value S2 into registers and calls the `asyncFuncRet` unique
  stub. The stub stores the result into the wait handle associated with the
  frame pointer, marks it as finished, unblocks its parents and if possible,
  directly resumes the first parent (fast path), or a pending fast runnable
  ResumableWaitHandle (slower path). Otherwise, it will exit VM and return
  control to the asio scheduler (slow path). The stack must contain exactly one
  cell containing uninitialized garbage, which will be populated by the stub
  either to pass the return value to the resumed function, or to return null
  to the scheduler.

| AsyncFuncRetSlow<spOff>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr) S(Cell), T

  Return from a resumed async function, assuming unknown surprise flag state
  after the previous surprise was handled by executing "return" event hook.
  Calls the `asyncFuncRetSlow` stub, which re-checks the surprise flag and
  transfers control to the AsyncFuncRet if it was clear, or performs the slow
  path of AsyncFuncRet if it was not, without resuming another function, as
  we are not able to call a potential "resume await" event hook from the stub.

| AsyncSwitchFast<spOff>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), T

  Switch control to another ResumableWaitHandle. Ensures that S0 + `spOff`
  (in cells) is stored in rvmsp and that S1 is stored in rvmfp and calls the
  `asyncSwitchCtrl` unique stub, which tries to resume a pending fast runnable
  ResumableWaitHandle (fast path) if possible, otherwise it will exit VM and
  return control to the asio scheduler (slow path). As with AsyncRetFast, the
  stack must contain exactly one cell containing uninitialied garbage.

| LdRetVal<T>, DParam(Gen), S(FramePtr), NF

  Load the return value from the already-returned-from ActRec pointed to by S0
  into the dest.  This is used by NativeImpl.  TODO(#7150575): We want to make
  NativeImpl return a TypedValue in the C++ ABI registers.

| DbgTrashRetVal, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  For debugging purposes.  Store kTVTrashJITRetVal to the return value slot on
  the activation record pointed to by S0.

| ReleaseVVAndSkip, ND, S(FramePtr), B

  Loads the VarEnv slot off the ActRec pointed to by S0. If it is null, does
  nothing. If it is an ExtraArgs, deallocates the ExtraArgs structure.
  Otherwise it frees the VarEnv and jumps to block B. This instruction may not
  occur in an inlined call.

| GenericRetDecRefs, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Does decrefs of all the current function's locals, where S0 is a pointer to
  the relevant activation record. This instruction may not occur in an inlined
  call.


10. Stores

| StMem, ND, S(MemToGen) S(Gen), NF

  Store S1 into the location pointed to by S0.

| StElem, ND, S(PtrToCell) S(Int) S(Cell), NF

  Store S2 into the location given by the index S1 from base pointer S0. The
  index in S1 is the number of bytes from the base in S0.

| StLoc<localId>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Gen), NF

  Store S1 to local number localId on the frame pointed to by S0.

| StLocPseudoMain<localId>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Gen), NF

  Behaves just like StLoc, except the hard requirement that it is only emitted
  for pseudo-mains. We don't optimize StGbl the same way as StLoc, as we need
  intraprocedural analysis to know whether the store is truly dead.

| StLocRange<localIds>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Gen), NF

  Store S1 to the local variables corresponding to localIds, on the frame
  pointed to by S0.

| StClsRefCls<slot>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Cls), NF

  Store S1 to class-ref's cls slot `slot` on the frame pointed to by S0.

| StClsRefTS<slot>, ND, S(FramePtr) SVArr, NF

  Store S1 to class-ref's reified generic slot `slot` on the frame pointed to
  by S0.

| StRef, ND, S(BoxedCell) S(Cell), NF

  Store the value in S1 into the RefData pointed to by S0. Stores the
  RefData::m_type also.

| StStk<offset>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(Gen), NF

  Store S1 to the stack pointed to by S0, at a given offset (in cells).

| StOutValue<index>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Gen), NF

  Store S1 in a caller allocated out-value vm stack cell index cells above
  S0 on the stack.

| DbgTrashStk<offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  For debugging purposes.  Store kTVTrashJITStk to the stack slot pointed to
  by S0, at a given offset (in cells).

| DbgTrashFrame<offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  For debugging purposes.  Store kTVTrashJITFrame to kNumActRecCells stack
  slots starting at the offset (in cells), and going toward higher memory
  addresses.

| DbgTrashMem, ND, S(MemToGen), NF

  For debugging purposes.  Store kTVTrashJITHeap to a heap slot pointed to by
  S0.

| RecordReifiedGenericsAndGetName<offset,size>, D(StaticStr), S(StkPtr), NF

  Creates a list of reified generics from the stack, adds them to the reified
  generics table and returns mangled name used as the key

| RecordReifiedGenericsAndGetTSList<offset,size>, DVArr, S(StkPtr), NF

  Creates a list of reified generics from the stack, adds them to the reified
  generics table and returns this type structure list

| MangleReifiedName, D(StaticStr), S(StaticStr) S(StaticStr), NF

  Mangles the name from S0 with the mangled type structure string from S1


11. Trace exits

| EagerSyncVMRegs, ND, S(FramePtr) S(StkPtr), NF

  Sync the given vmfp and vmsp to their in-memory locations.

| ReqBindJmp<bcOff,transFlags>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), T

  Emit a jump to a REQ_BIND_JMP service request to the target offset bcOff.

| ReqRetranslate<transFlags>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), T

  Emit a jump to a service request that will chain to a retranslation of this
  tracelet.

  This instruction is used in exit traces for a type prediction that occurs at
  the first bytecode offset of a tracelet.

| ReqRetranslateOpt<transId,bcOff>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), T

  Emit a service request to retranslate, with a higher optimization gear,
  translation transID, which starts at bcOff. This instruction is used in exit
  traces that trigger profile-guided optimizations.


12. Refcounting and copies

| Mov, DofS(0), S(Top), P

  Defines D as S0. May imply register-to-register moves at code generation
  time. Does not imply an incref or any other manipulation of S0.

| IncRef, ND, S(Gen,Ctx), NF

  If S0 is a refcounted type, increment its refcount.

| DecRef<locId>, ND, S(Gen,Ctx), CRc

  Decrease the reference count of S0 by one, and call a destructor for types
  that require it if it goes to zero.

  Note that although DecRef takes a Gen, we don't allow it to use information
  about the inner types of a BoxedCell. This is because we don't guard on the
  inner types of a BoxedCell except when doing LdRef. For any S0 that is a
  strict subtype of BoxedCell, the DecRef must just decref it as if it were a
  BoxedCell.

  The locId is just a hint to the runtime indicating which local variable is
  being DecRef'd, if any.

| DecRefNZ, ND, S(Gen,Ctx), CRc

  Decrease the reference count of S0 by one, do not check if it goes to zero.
  This instruction can be used for more efficient code when it is provable that
  the reference count cannot go to zero.


13. Misc

| DefFP, D(FramePtr), NA, NF

  Creates a temporary D representing the current vm frame pointer.

| DefSP<stackOff>, D(StkPtr), S(FramePtr), NF

  Creates a temporary D representing the current vm stack pointer. S0 is a
  pointer to the current frame. The 'stackOff' is the logical offset between S0
  and the stack pointer, but in the case of generators this is not the
  physical offset at runtime.

  This instruction is used at the beginning of tracelets to represent the state
  of the stack on entry and does not emit code.

| FuncGuard<func,prologueAddrPtr>, ND, NA, NF

  Emits a function guard for func, and arranges to write the address of the
  following instruction to prologueAddrPtr.

| Count, D(Int), S(Cell), NF

  Computes the number of elements in S0. The count of an array is the number of
  elements it contains, without recursing into containers in the array.
  Subtypes of Bool|Int|Dbl|Str|Res have a count of 1, subtypes of Null have a
  count of 0. The count of objects that implement the Countable interface is
  computed by returning the value of their count method. Objects that do not
  implement Countable have a count of 1.

| CountArray,      D(Int), S(Arr),    NF

| CountArrayFast,  D(Int), S(Arr),    NF

| CountVec,        D(Int), S(Vec),    NF

| CountDict,       D(Int), S(Dict),   NF

| CountShape,      D(Int), S(Shape),  NF

| CountKeyset,     D(Int), S(Keyset), NF

| CountCollection, D(Int), S(Obj),    NF

  Computes the number of elements in S0 using the same definition as Count, but
  with a restriction on the input type.

  CountArray expects any array. CountArrayFast expects an array whose kind is
  not kGlobalsKind. CountCollection expects a collection object.

| Nop, ND, NA, NF

  Does nothing. It's sometimes useful for the simplifier to insert one of these
  in the instruction stream.

| ExitPlaceholder, ND, NA, B

  Does nothing if executed. Semantically, this instruction carries a taken edge
  to a block that was a pure side-exit during initial IR generation.  This
  allows later passes to test conditions and create new exits from the region
  at this point in the program.

14. Runtime helpers

| VerifyParamCls, ND, S(Cls) S(Cls|Nullptr) C(Int) C(Int), NF

  Verify parameter type for classes or traits. If S0 does not extend (if S1 is
  a class) or implement (if S1 is an interface) S1, this instruction will raise
  a recoverable fatal error describing the type mismatch.

| VerifyParamCallable, ND, S(Gen) C(Int), NF

  If S0 is not callable, as defined by the php function is_callable, this
  instruction will raise a recoverable fatal error describing the type
  mismatch.

| VerifyParamFail, ND, C(Int), NF

  Assumes that parameter number S0 in the current function has failed a its
  type check. Depending on the typehint being verified and a number of runtime
  options, may coerce the parameter to the correct type or raise a recoverable
  fatal error describing the type mismatch.

| VerifyParamFailHard, ND, C(Int), T

  A terminal version of VerifyParamFail, to be used when the compiler can
  statically prove that this failure will result in a fatal error rather than a
  type coercion.

| VerifyRetCallable, ND, S(Gen), NF

  Verify a return type hint.

| VerifyRetCls, ND, S(Cls) S(Cls|Nullptr) C(Int) S(Cell), NF

  Verify a return type hint.

| VerifyRetFail, ND, S(PtrToGen), NF

  Failure to verify a return type hint.

| VerifyRetFailHard, ND, S(PtrToGen), T

  Terminal version of VerifyRetFail, to be used when the compiler can prove
  that this failure will result in a fatal error.

| VerifyPropCls, ND, S(Cls) S(Int) S(Cls|Nullptr) S(Obj) C(Bool), NF

  Verify a property type hint with AnnotType::Object against an object
  value. S0 is the class of the object containing the property. S1 is the slot
  of the property on the class. S3 is the object which is being set in the
  property. If S2 is not nullptr, than the type-hint refers to that Class, and
  S3 will be checked to see if its an instance of S2. Otherwise, the type-hint
  refers to a type-alias, and the alias will be resolved and checked against
  S3. S4 is true if this is a static property, false otherwise.

| VerifyPropFail, ND, S(Cls) S(Int) S(Cell) C(Bool), NF

  Failure to verify a property type hint. S0 is the class of the object
  containing the property. S1 is the slot of the property on the class. S2 is
  the value which was being set in the property. S3 is true if this is a static
  property, false otherwise.

| VerifyPropFailHard, ND, S(Cls) S(Int) S(Cell) C(Bool), T

  Terminal version of VerifyPropFail, to be used when the compiler can prove
  that this failure will result in a fatal error.

| VerifyProp, ND, S(Cls) S(Int) S(Cell) C(Bool), NF

  Verify that S2 is compatible with the type hint for the property at slot S1
  on S0. S3 is true if this is a static property, false otherwise.

| VerifyReifiedLocalType<id>, ND, SDArr, NF

  Raises a catchable type hint error if the reified generics of function
  parameter id does not match the type structure given on S0.

| VerifyReifiedReturnType, ND, S(Cell) SDArr, NF

  Raises a catchable type hint error if the reified generics of S0 does not
  match the type structure given on S1.

| RaiseHackArrParamNotice<type,id,isReturn>, ND, S(Arr) S(Func), NF

  Raise a HackArrCompatNotice corresponding to a parameter or return type-hint
  d/varray mismatch. S0 is the array being passed in. S1 is the function being
  called.

| RaiseHackArrPropNotice<type>, ND, S(Cls) S(Arr) S(Int) C(Bool), NF

  Raise a HackArrCompatNotice corresponding to a property type-hint d/varray
  mismatch.

| RaiseUninitLoc<localId>, ND, S(Str), NF

  Raise a notice for an uninitialized local variable.

| RaiseUndefProp, ND, S(Obj) CStr, NF

  Raise a notice for an undefined property named S1 on the class of S0.

| RaiseMissingArg<func,argc>, ND, NA, NF

  Raise a missing argument warning because only argc arguments were passed to
  function func.

| RaiseTooManyArg<func,argc>, ND, NA, NF

  Raise a too many argument warning because argc arguments were passed to
  function func.

| RaiseError, ND, S(Str), T

  Raises a fatal error with the text in S0 as its message.

| RaiseWarning, ND, S(Str), NF

  Raises a warning with the text in S0 as its message.

| RaiseNotice, ND, S(Str), NF

  Raises a notice with the text in S0 as its message.

| RaiseArrayIndexNotice<isInOut>, ND, S(Int), NF

  Raises a notice that S0 is an undefined index for an array. The isInOut option
  indicates that the access was for an inout parameter.

| RaiseArrayKeyNotice<isInOut>, ND, S(StaticStr), NF

  Raises a notice that S0 is an undefined key for an array. The isInOut option
  indicates that the access was for an inout parameter.

| RaiseMissingThis, ND, S(Func), NF

  Raises an appropriate notice or fatal to indicate that Func was
  called with null $this. In most cases its a notice, but for
  builtins and special class methods its a fatal.

| RaiseHasThisNeedStatic, ND, S(Func), NF

  Raises a notice to indicate that func was called on an object but is a static
  method.

| FatalMissingThis, ND, S(Func), T

  Similar to RaiseMissingThis, but for cases where we know it will fatal.

| RaiseHackArrCompatNotice, ND, S(Str), NF

  Raises a Hack array compat notice with the text in S0 as its message.

| RaiseParamRefMismatchForFunc<paramIndex>, ND, S(Func), T

  Raise a warning or exception indicating that the reffiness of a parameter was
  incorrectly annotated at the callsite.

| RaiseForbiddenDynCall, ND, S(Func), NF

  Depending on the setting of the `ForbidDynamicCalls` runtime option, either
  raise a warning or throw an exception indicating that the func specified in
  S0 was called dynamically (and should not be).

| RaiseForbiddenDynConstruct, ND, S(Cls), NF

  Depending on the setting of the `ForbidDynamicCalls` runtime option, either
  raise a warning or throw an exception indicating that the class specified in
  S0 was constructed dynamically (and should not be).

| RaiseStrToClassNotice, ND, S(Str), NF

  Raise a notice if a string is implicitly converted to a class.

| CheckClsReifiedGenericMismatch<cls>, ND, SVArr, NF

  Raises a runtime error unless whether each generic in S0 is reified or erased
  matches exactly to the expectations of the cls.

| CheckFunReifiedGenericMismatch<func>, ND, SVArr, NF

  Raises a runtime error unless whether each generic in S0 is reified or erased
  matches exactly to the expectations of the func.

| CheckStaticLoc<func,staticLocalName>, ND, NA, B

  Check whether the static local variable named 'staticLocalName' for
  function 'func' is initialized in RDS, and branch if not.

| InitStaticLoc<func,staticLocalName>, ND, S(Cell), NF

  Initialize the static local variable named 'staticLocalName' for
  function 'func' with S0.

| InitClsCns<className,constName>, DCns, NA, PRc

  Initialize the RDS entry for a constant for a class, invoking autoload if it
  is not defined. The initialized value is returned. This instruction may raise
  an undefined constant error if autoload cannot define the constant.

| PrintStr,  ND, S(Str),  CRc

| PrintInt,  ND, S(Int),  CRc

| PrintBool, ND, S(Bool), CRc

  Print for various types.

| AddElemStrKey, D(Arr), S(Arr) S(Str) S(Cell), CRc|PRc

  Add S2 to the array S0 for the key S1, and return the resulting array.

| AddElemIntKey, D(Arr), S(Arr) S(Int) S(Cell), CRc|PRc

  Add S2 to the array S0 for the key S1, and return the resulting array.

| AddNewElem, D(Arr), S(Arr) S(Cell), CRc|PRc

| AddNewElemKeyset, D(Keyset), S(Keyset) S(Cell), CRc|PRc

| AddNewElemVec, D(Vec), S(Vec) S(Cell), CRc|PRc

  Add S1 as a new element to the array/keyset/vec S0.  (Note: S1 must actually
  be a subtype of InitCell for array invariants, but we can't assert this yet
  in the IR because many eval stack slots are not entirely typed wrt initness
  right now.)

| DictAddElemStrKey, D(Dict), S(Dict) S(Str) S(Cell), CRc|PRc

  Add S2 to the dict S0 for the key S1, and return the resulting dict.

| DictAddElemIntKey, D(Dict), S(Dict) S(Int) S(Cell), CRc|PRc

  Add S2 to the dict S0 for the key S1, and return the resulting dict.

| ArrayAdd, D(Arr), S(Arr) S(Arr), CRc|PRc

  Has the effects of array_key_exists(S0, S1) on an object S0. This either does
  collection accesses, or uses the ArrayAccess API.

| GetMemoKey, DMemoKey, S(Cell), PRc

  Given a cell, produces a string or an int that can be used as a memoize cache
  key. Valid values for the input include all basic types, arrays and
  collections, and objects that implement IMemoizeParam. Any other type will
  cause GetMemoKey to throw. This op can only be used within functions marked
  as memoize wrappers.

| GetMemoKeyScalar, DMemoKey, S(Uncounted,Str), PRc

  Identical to GetMemoKey but only accepts scalar types and cannot produce
  errors.

| ArrayIdx, DArrElem, S(Arr) S(Int,Str) S(Cell), NF

  Creates a service request to bind the given target address. Returns a TCA
  pointing either to the service request (before the service request is
  satisfied) or to the native code for the given target address (once the
  service request is satisfied).

| LdSwitchDblIndex, D(Int), S(Dbl) S(Int) S(Int), NF

| LdSwitchStrIndex, D(Int), S(Str) S(Int) S(Int), CRc

| LdSwitchObjIndex, D(Int), S(Obj) S(Int) S(Int), CRc

  These instructions are used to determine the target of a switch statement
  with target range [S1:S1 + S2), when invoked with the value S0. They call
  helper functions to check whether S0 is an numeric integer in the range
  [S1:S1 + S2), and if so return the value S1 - (Int)S0. Else, they return the
  target of the default target, S2 + 1.

| LdSSwitchDestSlow, D(TCA), S(Gen), NF

  Load string switch destinations (two different compilation strategies).

|                                               S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr),
|                                               NF

  Call the interpreter implementation function for one opcode. S0 + `spOff' (in
  cells) and S1 are, respectively, the VM stack and frame pointers before this
  instruction. T is only present if the instruction pushes to the stack, in
  which case it is the type of the top stack element after the call. `bcOff' is
  the bytecode offset. `numPopped' is the number of stack cells consumed by the
  instruction, and `numPushed' is the number of stack cells produced by the
  instruction.

| InterpOneCF<T,bcOff,numPopped,numPushed>, ND,
|                                           S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr),
|                                           T

  Similar to InterpOne, but for instructions that may modify vmpc. This is
  implemented as a tail call to a stub, so any exceptions thrown will be thrown
  in the context of the stub, not the InterpOneCF instruction.

  Returns a double of the current time in seconds.

| GetTimeNs, D(Int), C(Int), NF

  Returns the current time of the given clock id specified as clockid_t in
  nanoseconds as integer. This will call kernel's clock_gettime_ns() API. Note
  that this cannot be used for CLOCK_THREAD_CPUTIME_ID, as HHVM provides
  different semantics for that counter.

| KillClsRefCls<slot>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Mark the class-ref's cls slot `slot` in frame S0 as no longer containing a
  meaningful value. This is used to aid in memory analysis. In debugging
  builds, it may overwrite the slot with a poison value.

| KillClsRefTS<slot>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Mark the class-ref's reified generic slot `slot` in frame S0 as no longer
  containing a meaningful value. This is used to aid in memory analysis.

|                                   NF

  Enters a generator body. S0 + `spOffset' (in cells) is a pointer to the
  stack, S1 is the current frame pointer, S2 is the generator frame pointer
  embedded in the Generator object, and S3 is the address to jump to. The
  `callBCOffset' will be stored to the m_callOff field of the ActRec in
  the generator.

| ContPreNext, ND, S(Obj) C(Bool), B

  Performs operations needed for the next() method of Generator object S0.

17. Iterators

| IterInit<IterData>,   D(Bool), S(ArrLike,Obj) S(FramePtr), CRc

| IterInitK<IterData>,  D(Bool), S(ArrLike,Obj) S(FramePtr), CRc

| LIterInit<IterData>,  D(Bool), S(ArrLike) S(FramePtr), NF

| LIterInitK<IterData>, D(Bool), S(ArrLike) S(FramePtr), NF

  <IterData> consists of three indices, iterId, keyId and valId. iterId is
  the index of the iterator variable, keyId and valId are indices of local
  variables.

  Initializes the iterator variable whose index is given by iterId.
  This instruction creates the appropriate iterator for the array or object that
  S0 references, and rewinds the new iterator to its start. S0 points to the
  stack frame containing the iterator and local variables with the indices
  iterId, keyId and valId.

  If the new iterator is at its end (i.e., has no elements to iterate over),
  this instruction decrements the refcount of S0 and returns false; otheriwse,
  it stores a reference to S0 in the new iterator and returns true. If the
  iterator is not at its end, then this instruction stores the iterator's first
  value (and key) into the local variable with index valId (and keyId,
  respectively).

  The IterInit and IterInitK instructions always copy the array element by
  value.

  The LIter variations only accept arrays and do not take ownership of their
  base. Instead the base is provided on each operation on the iterator. This
  avoids having to raise the ref-count of the base (in situations where this is
  safe).

  This instruction has the ConsumesRC property because it either decrements the
  reference count of S0 or stores a reference to S0 into the new iterator.

| IterNext<IterData>,   D(Bool), S(FramePtr), NF

| IterNextK<IterData>,  D(Bool), S(FramePtr), NF

| LIterNext<IterData>,  D(Bool), S(ArrLike) S(FramePtr), NF

| LIterNextK<IterData>, D(Bool), S(ArrLike) S(FramePtr), NF

  <IterData> consists of three indices, iterId, keyId and valId. iterId is
  the index of the iterator variable, keyId and valId are indices of local
  variables.  S0 points to the stack frame containing the iterator and local
  variables with the indices iterId, keyId and valId.

  Advances the iterator variable whose index is given by iterId.

  If the iterator has reached the end, this instruction frees the iterator
  variable and returns false; otherwise, it returns true. If the iterator has
  not reached its end, then this instruction stores the iterator's next value
  (and key) into the local variable with index valId (and keyId, respectively).

  The IterInit and IterInitK instructions always copy the array element by
  value.

| IterFree,  ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Free the iterator variable whose index is given by S1 in the stack frame
  pointed to by S0.


18. Member instruction support

| LdMIStateAddr, D(PtrToMISGen), C(Int), NF

  Load an MInstrState address. Returns a pointer to offset S0 within the
  current MInstrState.

| LdMBase, DParam(LvalToGen), NA, NF

  Load the current value of the member base register.

| StMBase, ND, S(LvalToGen), NF

  Store a new value to the member base register. It is illegal for any
  instruction other than StMBase or InterpOne (when interpreting a member
  instruction) to modify the member base register.

| LdMIPropStateAddr, D(MIPropSPtr), NA, NF

  Load an address to the current MInstrPropState.

| StMIPropState, ND, S(Cls|Nullptr) S(Int) C(Bool), NF

  Write to the current MInstrPropState.

| FinishMemberOp, ND, NA, NF

  Mark the end of a member operation. This has no effect at runtime but exists
  to provide information for certain optimizations.

All of the remaining opcodes in this section are simple wrappers around helper
functions (specified in S0) to perform the corresponding vector operation. If
S1 is a ConstCls it represents the context class for the operation.

SetElem, SetProp, and SetNewElem are used to implement part of the SetM hhbc
opcode, which almost always pushes its first stack input or a StaticStr as its
stack result. The combinations of input types that cause SetM to push anything
other than those two values are vanishingly rare in correct PHP programs, so
these three instructions have been optimized for the common cases. SetNewElem
and SetProp have no destination, allowing the compiler to predict that the
SetM's output will be the same as its input (and optimize accordingly). If that
turns out to not be the case at runtime, the instruction will throw an
InvalidSetMException. The exception will hold a Cell containing the value the
SetM should push on the stack instead of its input value. The runtime is
responsible for catching this exception, finishing execution of the SetM
instruction, pushing the value from the exception on the stack, and proceeding
as appropriate (most likely with a side exit to the next bytecode instruction,
since it has pushed an unexpected type onto the stack).

SetElem is similar to SetProp and SetNewElem but can also be used for setting
characters within strings. When given a string base and a valid offset, SetElem
returns a string representation of the newly inserted character. In all other
cases it returns nullptr or throws an InvalidSetMException. It will throw this
exception when it detects invalid input types, or when trying to set a string
offset that would grow the string beyond the maximum supported size.

The input types that will cause the errors described above are listed here:

SetNewElem will fail if the base is not a subtype of {Null|Str|Arr|Obj} and not
           Bool<false>.
SetElem has the same base constraint as SetNewElem. In addition, the key must
        not be a subtype of {Arr|Obj}.
SetProp will fail if the base is not a subtype of {Obj|Null}.

Any instructions that take a pointer to an MInstrState struct use the various
fields of that struct for holding intermediate values.

| BaseG, D(LvalToRMembCell), S(Str), NF

  Get a base from global named S0.

  NB: BaseG returns either a PtrToGblGen, OR a pointer to a ref that is rooted
  in a GblGen.  (I.e. the unbox happens in the C++ helper that this instruction
  calls.)  If it is not a defining BaseG it can also return the
  init_null_variant, so for now it returns a PtrToRMembCell.

| PropX, D(LvalToMembGen), S(Obj,LvalToGen) S(Cell) S(PtrToMISGen), NF

| ElemArrayX<M>, D(LvalToMembGen), S(Arr) S(Int,Str), NF

| ElemArrayD<T>, D(LvalToElemGen), S(LvalToGen) S(Int,Str), MElem

| ElemArrayU<T>, D(LvalToMembGen), S(LvalToGen) S(Int,Str), MElem

  Similar to ElemX, but the base S0 is an array and the key S1 is an int/str.
  ElemArrayD is for Define member instrs, ElemArrayU is for Unset, and
  ElemArrayX is for InOut, Warn, and None instrs (where the mode is M).

  replace S0.

| ArraySetRef, ND, S(Arr) S(Int,Str) S(Cell) S(BoxedCell), CRc

  Like ArraySet, but for binding operations on the array. S3 must point to a
  RefData with an array type when this instruction is executed, and it must be
  the same array that is in S0.

  Set element with key S1 in S0 to S2. The dest will be a new Vec that should
  replace S0.

  Set element with key S1 in S0 to S2. SetElem returns a Nullptr in the common
  case, where the logical result of the hhbc SetM is its right hand side. In
  the case of string bases, the SetM returns a new string containing the newly
  inserted character. So the return value of this instruction is Nullptr unless
  SetM needed to return a static string.

  Furthermore, in the case of "invalid offsets", SetElem may throw an
  InvalidSetMException (see discussion above).

| ProfileType, ND, S(Gen), NF

  Profile the type of S0.

| LdPackedArrayDataElemAddr<T>, DParam(LvalToElemGen), S(AK(Packed),Vec) S(Int), NF

  Loads the address of the element at index S1 of the packed array or vec array
  in S0. This instruction assumes the array actually contains an element at
  that offset (IE, the array has the proper length).

| ReservePackedArrayDataNewElem, D(Int), S(AK(Packed),Vec), B

  If there is room in the packed or vec array (which is assumed to be mutable),
  increments the array size and returns the index of the new last element
  (which you must initialize); else jumps to the taken branch.

19. Exception/unwinding support

| BeginCatch, ND, NA, NF

  Marks the beginning of a catch region. Exact behavior is implementation and
  architecture specific.

| EndCatch<spOffset>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(StkPtr), T

  Marks the end of a catch region and returns control to the unwinder.  The
  `spOffset' field represents a logical adjustment to S1 (in cells) to yield
  the vm stack pointer, however the stack pointer is not actually adjusted
  before this instruction returns control to the unwinder.  The unwinder
  instead relies on fixup map information to find the appropriate stack
  pointers.  Instead it's part of this instruction to facilitate assertions and
  memory effect analysis.

| UnwindCheckSideExit, ND, S(FramePtr) S(StkPtr), B

  Branches to B if the currently executing catch region should return control
  to the unwinder rather than side exiting.  Used to control behavior in catch
  traces for the InvalidSetMException and TVCoercionException situations.

| LdUnwinderValue<T>, DParam(Cell), NA, PRc

  Loads the value contained by the current unwinder exception.


20. Function prologues

| EnterFrame, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Stash the return address of the call in m_savedRip.

| CheckStackOverflow, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Check if the stack depth has exceeded its limit.  If it has, jump to the
  stack overflow helper stub, which will throw.

| InitExtraArgs<func,argc>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Set up the ExtraArgs struct on the live ActRec.  If extra args are present
  and need to be discarded, they will be decref'd and may re-enter to run
  destructors.

| InitCtx, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Ctx,Nullptr), CRc

  Store S1 to the m_this/m_cls field in the frame pointer S0.

  If InitCtx appears in an IR unit, it must dominate all occurrences of LdCtx
  and LdCctx with the same FramePtr.

| CheckSurpriseFlagsEnter<func,argc>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Test the implementation-specific surprise flags.  If they're nonzero, call
  the function enter helper.

| CheckSurpriseAndStack<func,args>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Test surprise flags and stack overflow at the same time.

| CheckARMagicFlag, ND, S(FramePtr), B

  If the MagicDispatch flags on the ActRec pointed to by the frame pointer S0
  are not set, branch to block B.

| LdARNumArgsAndFlags, D(Int), S(FramePtr), NF

  Load the value of m_numArgsAndFlags on the ActRec pointed to by the frame
  pointer S0.

| StARNumArgsAndFlags, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Int), NF

  Store S1 to m_numArgsAndFlags on the ActRec pointed to by the frame pointer
  S0.

| LdARInvName, D(Str), S(FramePtr), NF

  Load the value of m_invName off the ActRec pointed to by the frame pointer S0.
  The compiler should generate this only if it knows that m_invName is a
  StringData* (rather than, e.g., a VarEnv*).

| StARInvName, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Str,Nullptr), CRc

  Store S1 to m_invName on the ActRec pointed to by the frame pointer S0.

| PackMagicArgs, DVArr, S(FramePtr), PRc

  pointed to by the frame pointer S0 as the first argument, and the pointer to
  the first parameter in the frame as the second argument.

| LdTVAux<ValidBits>, D(Int), S(Gen), NF

  Load the value of m_aux from the TypedValue S0.  ValidBits is a mask
  specifying which bits are allowed to be set.  The runtime may ignore it.

  Note that when we pass TypedValues around in registers, we usually use a byte
  register for the m_type member, and thus ignore m_aux.  LdTVAux is only valid
  when we know that S0's m_type and m_aux were both materialized into the same
  64-bit register.

| StARReifiedGenerics<spoff>, ND, S(StkPtr) SVArr, NF

  Store S1 to m_reifiedGenerics on the ActRec pointed to by the stack pointer
  S0 and the stack pointer offet. Also, sets the HasReifiedGenerics bit of the
  m_numArgsAndFlags on the same ActRec.

| LdARReifiedGenerics, DVArr, S(FramePtr), NF

  Load the value of m_reifiedGenerics on the ActRec pointed to by the frame
  pointer S0.

| KillARReifiedGenerics, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Mark the ActRec's m_reifiedGenerics pointer in frame S0 as no longer
  containing a meaningful value. This can used to aid in memory analysis.
  In debugging builds, it may overwrite the pointer with a poison value.
