/*
 * General effect information used by most IR instructions.  The instruction
 * may load or store to different alias classes, as well as have any other
 * side-effects.
 *
 * Locations that contain PHP values are assumed (except for `moves', see
 * below) to be affected with normal VM semantics with regard to memory
 * barriers---that is, if the instruction loads from a `loads' location and
 * keeps a pointer to the value, it must IncRef it, and if the instruction
 * stores to a `stores' location, it must decref the old value that was in
 * memory (if there could be any) and incref the one it is storing.  The reason
 * to make this expectation clear is for the use of this module by refcount
 * optimizations.  Note that this means that instructions which do nothing but
 * store a php value to a location (without decreffing the old value that may
 * have been there) cannot use GeneralEffects to represent that (they must use
 * PureStore)---the same thing does not /quite/ apply to loads.
 *
 * Furthermore, all locations that contain values the instruction may decref
 * should be included in `stores', even if (as an "optimization") we don't need
 * to store anything over it.  This requirement basically only applies to
 * GenericRetDecRefs.
 *
 * The exception to the "normal VM semantics" is for values in the class
 * `moves', which must always be a subclass of `loads'.  This set of locations
 * may be loaded by the instruction, but in order to `transfer' them to another
 * memory location (which must be somewhere in its `stores' set), without an
 * IncRef.  Note: this set is also may-information---and it is required to
 * contain any location this instruction may do this to for correct analysis in
 * refcount optimizations (it must be conservatively "too big" rather than too
 * small).
 *
 * Additionally, there is a set `kills'.  For this set of locations, when the
 * instruction executes (before any of its other effects), it becomes
 * semantically illegal for any part of the program to read from those
 * locations again (without writing to them first).  This is used for the
 * ReturnHook to prevent uses of the stack and frame, and for killing stack
 * slots below the re-entry depth for potentially re-entering instructions.
 *
 * If there is an overlap between `loads' and `kills', then `kills' takes
 * precedence for locations that are contained in both (i.e. those locations
 * should be treated as actually killed).

 *
 * The `outputs' set contains stack locations the call will write inout

 * ReturnEffects is a return, either from the php function or an inlined
 * function.  You may assume if the instruction it came from is not an
 * InlineReturn, it is a return from the entire region.  It does not cover
 * suspending a resumable, but it covers returning from a suspended resumable.
 *
 * All locals on the returning frame may be considered dead after
 * ReturnEffects.  However, the stack is a little more complicated.  The
 * `kills' set is an additional alias class of locations that cannot be read
 * after the return, which is used to provide the range of stack that can be
 * considered dead.  In normal functions it will effectively be AStackAny, but
 * in generators a return may still leave part of the eval stack alive for the
 * caller.  When returning from an inlined function, the locals may all be
 * considered dead, and `kills' will contain the whole inlined function's
 * stack.
