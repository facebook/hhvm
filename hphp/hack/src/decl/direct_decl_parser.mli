  (** This causes the listed relative-paths to go in a per-handle queue to be
  direct-decl-parsed. You can trust that multiple cores will be used
  to do that parsing. This function will block until the next
  available path has been parsed -- it might be one of the paths
  we passed into this call, or it might even have been an earlier call.

  It is normal to invoke this function with an empty list, indicating that
  the caller has no further workitems they wish to add, but they still
  want to finish collecting results from previous calls.

  This function will return [Some] with a result, or [None] if there
  will be no further results (i.e. if all pending paths have been done).

  The caller can provide metadata. For a given [(path, metadata)] that's passed in,
  it will be returned (either on this call or a subsequent call) with the exact
  same [(path, metadata)]. *)
