# Suites

Tests are grouped into "suites". They are just directories. Suites can have
subdirectories if you want to group them even more. Running a suite will run
all sub-suites.

* quick - High quality high signal tests. No duplicated logic. If you aren't
  sure, your test doesn't belong here.
* slow - Slower full featured tests. Grouped into sub-suites. By default put
  your test here.
* zend/good - Passing tests from Zend's suite.
* zend/bad - Failing tests from Zend. Fix these and move them to zend/good.
* zend/flakey - Tests which mostly pass but have race conditions or can't be
  parallelized.

# Examples how to run them

* Quick suite with the JIT on -
`test/run test/quick`

* Zend tests just with the interpreter in RepoAuthoritative mode -
`test/run test/zend/good -m interp -r`

* Slow tests with the JIT in PGO mode -
`test/run test/slow -m pgo`

* Slow tests with the JIT, using `pseudomain_wrapper.php` to ensure that
  statements in global scope get jitted (may have false positives due to,
  e.g. backtraces changing) -
`test/run test/slow -m automain`

* Run everything that is supposed to pass -
`test/run all`

# File Layout

The format is the same as Zend's `.phpt` but instead of sections it is
separate files with the section name converted to an extension. This allows
you to easily run the `.php` file without first running the test suite.

These are the allowed extensions:

* `.php` - The source of the test.
* `.php.expect` - The exact string expected output.
* `.php.expectf` - The exact string expected output with formating characters.
* `.php.expectregex` - A regex that matches the output.
* `.php.in` - When you run the test, the input will be obtained from here.
* `.php.out` - When you run the test, the output will be stored here.
* `.php.opts` - Runtime options to pass to hhvm.
* `.php.hphp_opts` - Options passed to hphp when generating a bytecode repo.
* `.php.diff or hhas.diff` - The diff for .expect tests.
* `.hhas` - HipHop Assembly.
* `.php.norepo` - don't run the test in repo mode
* `.php.noserver` - don't run the test in server mode

You must have one `.php`; one and only one of `.php.expect`, `.php.expectf`, and
`.php.expectregex`; and the rest are optional.

Any suite can have a `config.hdf` file in it that will be used. If one isn't
present, then the parent suite it checked recusrivly until we use
test/config.hdf.

If a suite contains an `hphpd.ini` file, all of the files in the suite will be
run with the `-m debug` and `--debug-config _dir_/hphpd.ini` switches added to
the command line. (`_dir_` will be replaced by path of the suite directory.)

Name your test in a descriptive manner and when in doubt break your test into
many files. You can use comments too so future engineers know if it is a real
breakage or they need to change the expected output.

## Format Characters

These can appear in `.expectf` files.

| Char    | Description                                | Regex
|---------|--------------------------------------------|-------
| %e      | Path separator                             | \/
| %s      | Any characters except newlines             | [^\r\n]+
| %S      | Optionally any characters except newlines  | [^\r\n]*
| %a      | Any characters                             | .+
| %A      | Optionally any characters                  | .*
| %w      | Optional whitespace                        | \s*
| %i      | Integer with optional sign                 | [+-]?\d+
| %d      | Digits                                     | \d+
| %x      | Hex                                        | [0-9a-fA-F]+
| %f      | Float                                      | [+-]?\.?\d+\.?\d|(?:[Ee][+-]?\d+)?
| %c      | Character                                  | .
| %r...%r | The ... is a regex                         | The part that is ...
