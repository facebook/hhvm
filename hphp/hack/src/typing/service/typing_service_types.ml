(**
  This module type exposes an API within hh_server running on the users' host
  that a component that distributes the work to other hosts can call.
  By analogy with MultiWorker, this component may be referred to as
  the controller: it dispatches batches of files to process (e.g., declare
  or type check) to workers.

  There are specific hh_server modules that know how to:
    - snapshot the naming table
    - get the list of files that changed since the merge base
    - import dependency graph edges

  The controller needs to be able to do these things, but it doesn't need to
  know how they are done and which server modules are responsible.

  This is why this module exists: to present a small API surface to
  the controller, providing only the functionality it needs from the server.

  Finally, the existence of this module makes it easy to mock its internals
  when testing the logic of the controller, instead of having to mock
  the individual modules that are responsible for the various operations, such
  as importing dependency graph edges.
