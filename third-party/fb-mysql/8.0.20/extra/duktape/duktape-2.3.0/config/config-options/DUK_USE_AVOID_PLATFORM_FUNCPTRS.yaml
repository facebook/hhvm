  Don't assume that platform functions (e.g. math functions) are actual
  functions.  This option is needed if platform functions may be defined
  as macros.  This is certainly the case with some platform "polyfills"
  which provide missing C99/C++11 functions through macros, and may be
  the case with VS2013 (see GH-17).

  This is now the default: the cost in footprint is negligible.
