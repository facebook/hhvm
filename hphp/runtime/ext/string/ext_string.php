 *   sometimes the standard DES-based algorithm is replaced by an MD5-based
 *   algorithm. The hash type is triggered by the salt argument. Prior to 5.3,
 *   PHP would determine the available algorithms at install-time based on the
 *   system's crypt(). If no salt is provided, PHP will auto-generate either a
 *   standard two character (DES) salt, or a twelve character (MD5), depending
 *   on the availability of MD5 crypt(). PHP sets a constant named
 *   CRYPT_SALT_LENGTH which indicates the longest valid salt allowed by the
 *   available hashes.  The standard DES-based crypt() returns the salt as the
 *   first two characters of the output. It also only uses the first eight
 *   characters of str, so longer strings that start with the same eight
 *   characters will generate the same result (when the same salt is used). On
 *   systems where the crypt() function supports multiple hash types, the
 *   following constants are set to 0 or 1 depending on whether the given type
 *   is available: CRYPT_STD_DES - Standard DES-based hash with a two character
 *   salt from the alphabet "./0-9A-Za-z". Using invalid characters in the salt
 *   will cause crypt() to fail. CRYPT_EXT_DES - Extended DES-based hash. The
 *   "salt" is a 9-character string consisting of an underscore followed by 4
 *   bytes of iteration count and 4 bytes of salt. These are encoded as
 *   printable characters, 6 bits per character, least significant character
 *   first. The values 0 to 63 are encoded as "./0-9A-Za-z". Using invalid
 *   characters in the salt will cause crypt() to fail. CRYPT_MD5 - MD5 hashing
 *   with a twelve character salt starting with $1$ CRYPT_BLOWFISH - Blowfish
 *   hashing with a salt as follows: "$2a$", a two digit cost parameter, "$",
 *   and 22 base 64 digits from the alphabet "./0-9A-Za-z". Using characters
 *   outside of this range in the salt will cause crypt() to return a
 *   zero-length string. The two digit cost parameter is the base-2 logarithm of
 *   the iteration count for the underlying Blowfish-based hashing algorithmeter
 *   and must be in range 04-31, values outside this range will cause crypt() to
 *   fail. CRYPT_SHA256 - SHA-256 hash with a sixteen character salt prefixed
 *   with $5$. If the salt string starts with 'rounds=<N>$', the numeric value
 *   of N is used to indicate how many times the hashing loop should be
 *   executed, much like the cost parameter on Blowfish. The default number of
 *   rounds is 5000, there is a minimum of 1000 and a maximum of 999,999,999.
 *   Any selection of N outside this range will be truncated to the nearest
 *   limit. CRYPT_SHA512 - SHA-512 hash with a sixteen character salt prefixed
 *   with $6$. If the salt string starts with 'rounds=<N>$', the numeric value
 *   of N is used to indicate how many times the hashing loop should be
 *   executed, much like the cost parameter on Blowfish. The default number of
