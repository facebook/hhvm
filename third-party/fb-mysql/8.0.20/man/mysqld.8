.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBmysqld\fR, also known as MySQL Server, is the main program that does most of the work in a MySQL installation\&. MySQL Server manages access to the MySQL data directory that contains databases and tables\&. The data directory is also the default location for other information such as log files and status files\&.

Some installation packages contain a debugging version of the server named
\fBmysqld\-debug\fR\&. Invoke this version instead of
\fBmysqld\fR
for debugging support, memory allocation checking, and trace file support (see
Section\ \&29.5.1.2, \(lqCreating Trace Files\(rq)\&.

When MySQL server starts, it listens for network connections from client programs and manages access to databases on behalf of those clients\&.
.PP
The
\fBmysqld\fR
program has many options that can be specified at startup\&. For a complete list of options, run this command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysqld \-\-verbose \-\-help\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
MySQL Server also has a set of system variables that affect its operation as it runs\&. System variables can be set at server startup, and many of them can be changed at runtime to effect dynamic server reconfiguration\&. MySQL Server also has a set of status variables that provide information about its operation\&. You can monitor these status variables to access runtime performance characteristics\&.
.PP
For a full description of MySQL Server command options, system variables, and status variables, see
Section\ \&5.1, \(lqThe MySQL Server\(rq\&. For information about installing MySQL and setting up the initial configuration, see
Chapter\ \&2, Installing and Upgrading MySQL\&.
