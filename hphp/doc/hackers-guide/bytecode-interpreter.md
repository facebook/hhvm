# The HHVM interpreter

A typical interpreter consists of a loop that looks something like this:

```
while (1) {
  switch(*pc) {
    case ADD:
      /* add implementation */
      pc++;
      break;

    case SUB:
      /* sub implementation */
      pc++;
      break;

    /*
     * handlers for other bytecodes
     */
  }
}
```

That is, you have a loop which steps through bytecodes, examining each one.
The switch statement then causes the appropriate thing to happen based on
the bytecode.

If you try to find a code structure like this in HHVM, you won’t find it.
Instead, HHVM uses a somewhat complicated combination of macros and
templates. This cuts down on duplicated code (so the same fix doesn’t have
to be applied in dozens of places). It also makes the code harder for
newcomers to read and harder to do searches in the code (as some symbols
don’t directly exist in the source - they’re built by macros).

The interpreter is located in hhvm/hphp/runtime/vm/bytecode.cpp. In that
file, you’ll find dispatchImpl(). It’s declared as:

```
  template <bool breakOnCtlFlow> TCA dispatchImpl()
```

This is the function that implements the interpreter. Two different
versions are instantiated, one with breakOnCtlFlow set to true and one
with it set to false. Since these are constants, the compiler is smart
enough to elide the “if” statements that check breakOnCtlFlow. Instead,
the bodies of the “if”s are either never executed or always executed.
While at first glance it appears that we're paying the cost of runtime
checks, that's not actually the case.

When breakOnCtlFlow is true, the function will return to the caller when
a control flow (i.e. branch) instruction is encountered. If breakOnCtlFlow
is false, the interpreter will continue executing instructions until a
function-exiting instruction is reached. As of this writing, the
function-exiting instructions are RetC, RetV, NativeImpl, Await, CreateCont,
Yield, and YieldK. This list could change in the future.

There are two versions of the interpreter loop. The Windows version
(indicated with _MSC_VER) implements an ordinary switch-based
interpreter loop, while the gcc version implements a threaded interpreter.
In a threaded interpreter, the handler for each bytecode jumps directly to
the handler for the next bytecode rather than going to a single central
switch statement. This eliminates a jump to a different cache line and
improves branch prediction by allowing the processor’s branch predictor to
find associations between the bytecodes. These different mechanisms are
hidden by the DISPATCH_ACTUAL macro.

There are three separate parts to each bytecode handler. One part for
dealing with PHP debugging, one part for doing code coverage, and a third
part which implements the actual handler. These are contained in the
OPCODE_DEBUG_BODY, OPCODE_COVER_BODY, and OPCODE_MAIN_BODY macros
respectively. In the Windows case, these are just called sequentially. For
gcc code, it’s a little more complicated. Threaded interpreting uses a table
of labels to dispatch to the next handler. HHVM makes use of three such
tables. The first is called optabDirect. It contains labels that allow
jumping directly to OPCODE_MAIN_BODY. The second table is called optabCover. It
contains labels that cause jumping to OPCODE_COVER_BODY. OPCODE_COVER_BODY
then falls through to the OPCODE_MAIN_BODY. Lastly there is optabDbg. Its
labels cause jumping to OPCODE_DEBUG_BODY which falls through to
OPCODE_COVER_BODY which in turn falls through to OPCODE_MAIN_BODY.

Now, where are all these dozens of bytecode handlers? Some more compiler
magic is employed here. Since these are all going to look very similar,
their code is generated by macros. In several places a macro named simply
O() is defined and then there’s a line that just says OPCODES. What’s
happening here isn’t immediately obvious. The OPCODES macro is defined in
hphp/runtime/vm/hhbc.h. This is the single, central place which contains
everything you could ever want to know about each bytecode. The OPCODES
macro invokes the O macro for each bytecode. So any time you want to
generate code for every bytecode, you define an O macro and invoke the
OPCODES macro. Any pieces of information from the table in the OPCODES
macro that you don’t need can just be ignored by your macro.

```
//  name             immediates        inputs           outputs     flags
#define OPCODES \
  O(Nop,             NA,               NOV,             NOV,        NF) \
  O(EntryNop,        NA,               NOV,             NOV,        NF) \
  O(BreakTraceHint,  NA,               NOV,             NOV,        NF) \
  O(DiscardClsRef,   ONE(CAR),         NOV,             NOV,        NF) \
  O(PopC,            NA,               ONE(CV),         NOV,        NF) \
  O(PopV,            NA,               ONE(VV),         NOV,        NF) \
  ...
```


There are multiple use of the OPCODES macro in bytecodes.cpp. The
optabDirect, optabDebug, and optableCover are generated using it. The heart
of the interpreter is constructed by defining an O macro that uses the
OPCODE_DBG_BODY, OPCODE_COVER_BODY, and OPCODE_MAIN_BODY. The
OPCODE_MAIN_BODY itself uses a macro called DISPATCH which uses the
DISPATCH_ACTUAL macro mentioned earlier. So you have about five levels of
macros involved in creating the interpreter body.

```
  static const void *optabDirect[] = {
#define O(name, imm, push, pop, flags) \
    &&Label##name,
    OPCODES
#undef O
  };
```

The OPCODES macro is also used to create a set of functions named
interpOneNop(), interpOnePopA(), interpOnePopC(), etc. These functions can
be used to invoke each of the individual bytecode handlers, with logging
and statistics code also included. interpOneEntryPoints[] contains a table
of these functions, allowing them to be called from JIT code.

The last piece to understanding the interpreter is iopRetWrapper(). These
are a pair of function which are called by the OPCODE_MAIN_BODY macro.
These unify the two different kinds of return values from bytecode handlers.
The handlers either return void or return a TCA. Polymorphism causes the
appropriate iopRetWrapper to be called. Since both iopRetWrapper functions
return a TCA, the OPCODE_MAIN_BODY macro doesn’t have to see the difference.
The iopRetWrapper() functions in turn call the bytecode handlers which are
named iopXXXX (where XXXX is the name of the bytecode). The iopRetWrapper()
functions and all the bytecode handlers are declared OPTBLD_INLINE. This is
a macro that is empty for a debug build or ALWAYS_INLINE for a release
build. Thus all the code gets inlined in to the interpreter loop for a
release build.
