# Await

`await` suspends the execution of an async function until the result of the asynchronous operation represented by the expression
that follows this keyword, is available.

See [awaitables](/docs/hack/asynchronous-operations/awaitables) for details of `await`, and [async](/docs/hack/asynchronous-operations/introduction) for a
general discussion of asynchronous operations.
