  (* The sense of [command_needs_writes] is a little confusing.
     Recall that for editor_open_files, hh_server deems that the IDE is the
     source of truth for the contents of those files. Thus, the act of
     opening/closing/editing an IDE file is equivalent to altering ("writing")
     the content of the file.

     With these IDE actions, in order to avoid races, we will have the
     current typecheck stop [MultiThreadedCall.Cancel] before processing
     the open/edit/close command. That way, in case the current typecheck
     had previously read one version of the file contents, we'll be sure that
     the same typecheck won't read the new version of the file contents.
     Note that "cancel" in this context means cancel remaining fanout-typechecking
     work in the current round of [ServerTypeCheck.type_check], but don't throw
     away results from the files we've already typechecked; as soon as we've
     cancelled and handled this command, then continue on to the next round
     of [ServerTypeCheck.type_check] i.e. recalculate naming table and fanout
     and then typecheck this new fanout.

     (It's interesting to compare these to watchman, which does have races...
     all that watchman allows us is to get a notification *after the fact* that
     the file content has changed. The typecheck still gets cancelled, but it
     might have read conflicting file contents prior to cancellation.) *)

           IDE edits can come in quick succession and be immediately followed

           to stopping and resuming the global typechecking jobs, which leads to
           flaky experience. Here we set the flag [recheck_restart_is_needed] to [false] for
           Edit, meaning that after we've finished handling the edit then
           [ServerMain.persistent_client_interrupt_handler] will stop the natural
           full check from taking place (by setting [env.full_check_status = Full_check_needed]).
           The flag only has effect in the "false" direction which stops the full check
           from taking place; setting it to "true" won't force an already-stopped full check to resume.

           So what does cause a full check to resume? There are two heuristics, both of them crummy,
           aimed at making a decentishuser experience where (1) we don't resume so aggressively
           that we pay the heavy cost of starting+stopping, (2) the user is rarely too perplexed
           at why things don't seem to be proceeding.
           * In [ServerMain.watchman_interrupt_handler], if a file on disk is modified, then
             the typecheck will resume.
           * In [ServerMain.recheck_until_no_changes_left], if it's been 5.0s or more since the last Edit,
             then the typecheck will resume. *)
