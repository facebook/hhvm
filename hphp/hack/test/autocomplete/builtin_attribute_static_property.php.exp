__LateInit
  INSERT __LateInit
  built-in attribute
  Marks a property as late initialized. Normally properties are required to be initialized in the constructor.
__Soft
  INSERT __Soft
  built-in attribute
  A runtime type mismatch on this parameter/property will not throw a TypeError/Error. This is useful for migrating partial code where you're unsure about the type.
  
  The type checker will ignore this attribute, so your code will still get type checked. If the type is wrong at runtime, a warning will be logged and code execution will continue.
