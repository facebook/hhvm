Deprecated: Assigning the return value of new by reference is deprecated in %s on line 23
Compile-time strict error message should precede this.
$f initially points to the first object:
object(Inc)#%d (1) {
  ["id"]=>
  int(1)
}
Assigning new object directly to $k affects $f:
object(Inc)#%d (1) {
  ["id"]=>
  int(2)
}
Assigning new object by ref to $k removes it from $f's reference set, so $f is unchanged:
object(Inc)#%d (1) {
  ["id"]=>
  int(2)
}
