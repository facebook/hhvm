`await` suspends the execution of an async function until the result of the asynchronous operation represented by the expression
that follows this keyword, is available.

See [awaitables](../asynchronous-operations/awaitables.md) for details of `await`, and [async](../asynchronous-operations/introduction.md) for a
general discussion of asynchronous operations.
