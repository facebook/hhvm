  This template creates a Write method for Thrift typedefs.

  NOTE: use of a function (rather that an instance method) is intentional!
  Typedefs are implemented as Go type aliases (type Foo = Bar) under the hood,
  meaning that all instance methods are "inherited" by the alias (typedef).
  Implementing Write in the form of an instance method may result in a "method
  already declared" compilation error. So instead we must use a uniquely named
  Write function (with no receiver) which takes the alias (typedef) as an argument.
