  Record traceback data into Ecmascript error objects.

  When disabled, traceback data is not recorded, but fileName/lineNumber of
  the error cause are still recorded as explicit properties.  Disabling this
  option reduces footprint and makes error handling a bit faster, at the cost
  of less informative Ecmascript errors.
