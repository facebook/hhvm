Warning\n *\n * Some web servers (e.g. Apache) change the working directory of a script\n * when calling the callback function. You can change it back by e.g.\n * chdir(dirname($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME'])) in the callback function.\n *\n * Output buffers are stackable, that is, you may call ob_start() while\n * another ob_start() is active.
