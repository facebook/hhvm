Here's why:


Step 1 of 3

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this join point

File "refinment_is.php", line 8, character 3 - line 12, character 3:

  7 | function inter_is(A $a, C $c): C {
  8 |   »if($a is I) {

 10 |   } else {
 11 |     $z = $c;
 12 |   }«
 13 |   return $z;
 14 | }

and flows into this expression

File "refinment_is.php", line 13, character 10 - line 13, character 11:

 12 |   }
 13 |   return »$z«;
 14 | }

as the type of the local variable

which itself flows into this expression

File "refinment_is.php", line 13, character 3 - line 13, character 12:

 12 |   }
 13 |   »return $z;«
 14 | }

because it is used in a return position

The supertype comes from this hint

File "refinment_is.php", line 7, character 32 - line 7, character 32:

 3 | interface I {}
 4 | class A {}
 5 | class C extends A {}

 8 |   if($a is I) {
 9 |     $z = $a;


Step 2 of 3

The subtype is a union type so next I checked the subtype constraint is satisfied for all its elements.

The subtype comes from this `is` expression

File "refinment_is.php", line 8, character 6 - line 8, character 12:

 7 | function inter_is(A $a, C $c): C {

10 |   } else {

Step 3 of 3 (here is where the error occurred)

The subtype is an intersection type so next I checked that the subtype constraint is satisfied for at least one of its element.
