# This benchmark is not representative of real-world PHP applications

A real-world benchmarking suite is available at https://github.com/hhvm/oss-performance

This benchmarking suite is designed to be used as part of HHVM's development workflow, and is not designed or intended to be used outside of those specific workflows. It's not representative of real-world PHP applications or their performance on HHVM or any other PHP engine.

So if you're not developing HHVM, you should use the oss-performance benchmarker linked above -- the results from this suite won't translate at all into performance of real-world PHP applications.
