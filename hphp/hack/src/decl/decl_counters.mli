(** E.g. 'count_decl Class "Foo" (fun d -> <implementation>)'. The idea is that
<implementation> is the body of work which fetches the decl of class "foo",
and we want to record telemetry about its performance. This function will
execute <implementation>, and will internally keep track of things like how long
it took and what decl was fetched, and will log the telemetry appropriately.

The callback takes a parameter [d]. This is for use of subsidiary decl accessors,
e.g. 'count_subdecl d (Get_method "bar") (fun () -> <implementation2>)'. It's
so that, when we record telemetry about <implementation2>, we can relate it
back to the original count_decl which fetched the class Foo in the first place.
[d] is optional; it will be None if e.g. the original call to count_decl established
that no telemetry should be collected during this run, and we want to avoid
re-establishing this fact during the call to count_subdecl. *)

(** E.g. 'count_subdecl d (Get_method "bar") (fun () -> <implementation2>)'. The idea
is that <implementation2> is the body of work which fetches the decl of method 'bar'
of some class, and we want to record telemetry about its performance. This function
will execution <implementation2> , and will internally keep track of things like
how long it took, and will log the telemetry appropriately. *)
