System Requirements
-------------------

Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks (Intel(R) TBB) is available
commercially (see http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-tbb) as a
binary distribution, and in open source, in both source and binary
forms (see http://threadingbuildingblocks.org).

When built from source, Intel(R) TBB is intended to be highly portable
and so supports a wide variety of operating systems and platforms (see
http://threadingbuildingblocks.org for more details).

Known Issues
------------

Below is the list of known issues in this release of
Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks (Intel(R) TBB).
See the "Known Issues" appendix in the Intel(R) TBB Developer
Reference for notes applicable to multiple releases of Intel(R) TBB.

Library Issues

    - If you build Intel(R) TBB from sources with GCC 6, specify
        the -flifetime-dse=1 option to prevent crashes at runtime,
        or use Intel(R) TBB makefiles that automatically set this option.

    - The current implementation of gfx_factory does not allow memory
        buffer objects to be used concurrently. As a result, several
        streaming nodes customized with gfx_factory cannot be connected
        with each other directly.
