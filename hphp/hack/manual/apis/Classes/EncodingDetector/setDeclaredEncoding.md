:::info[Note]
This is a point-in-time snapshot of the API documentation from January 2026.
Going forward, we will not be maintaining a public copy of these references,
and recommend users to refer to the built-in signature helpers available in
the Hack LSP instead for complete and up-to-date information.
:::

If the user provided an encoding in metadata
(like an HTTP or XML declaration),
this can be used as an additional hint to the detector




``` Hack
public function setDeclaredEncoding(
  string $encoding,
): void;
```




## Parameters




+ ` string $encoding ` - Possible encoding for the byte array obtained
  from associated metadata




## Returns




* ` void `
