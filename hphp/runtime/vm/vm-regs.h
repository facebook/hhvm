/*
 * This file contains accessors for the three primary VM registers:
 *
 * vmpc(): PC pointing to the currently executing bytecode instruction
 * vmfp(): ActRec* pointing to the current frame
 * vmsp(): Cell* pointing to the top of the eval stack
 *
 * The registers are physically located in the RDS header struct (defined in
 * runtime/base/rds-header.h), allowing efficient access from translated code
 * when needed. They are generally not kept up-to-date in translated code,
 * though, so there are times when it is not safe to use them. This is tracked
 * in the tl_regState variable, which is automatically checked in the accessors
 * defined here. Certain parts of the runtime do need access to the registers
 * while their state is expected to be dirty; the vmRegsUnsafe() function is
 * provided for these rare cases.
 *
 * In a C++ function potentially called from translated code, VMRegAnchor
 * should be used before accessing any of these registers. jit::MCGenerator is
 * currently responsible for doing the work required to sync the VM registers,
 * though this is an implementation detail and should not matter to users of
 * VMRegAnchor.
