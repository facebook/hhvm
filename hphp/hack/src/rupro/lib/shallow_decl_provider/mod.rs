/// A get-or-compute interface for shallow decls (i.e., the type signature
/// information syntactically available in a file; the output of the
/// decl-parser).
///
/// Consumers of a `ShallowDeclProvider` expect the member-type accessors
/// (`get_method_type`, `get_constructor_type`, etc.) to be performant. For
/// instance, if our `Cache` implementations store data in a serialized format,
/// looking up a method type should only deserialize that individual method, not
/// the entire `ShallowClass` containing that method declaration.
///
/// Quick lookup of method and property types is useful because types of methods
/// and properties are omitted in the `FoldedClass` representation. This is done
/// to reduce copying and overfetching in `FoldedDeclProvider` implementations
/// which store data in a serialized format: we want to avoid copying the type
/// of a method which is inherited by 1000 classes into 1000 separate serialized
/// blobs. To avoid this, we serialize method types in a separate data store
/// keyed by `(TypeName, MethodName)`. Each method is stored only once, for the
/// class which defined the method. Inheritors must look up the method type
/// using the name of the "origin" class which defined it.
