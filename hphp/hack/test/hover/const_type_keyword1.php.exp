const
A `const type` declares a type constant inside a class. You can refer to type constants in signatures with `this::TMyConstType`.

Type constants are also a form of generics.

```
abstract class Pet {
  abstract const type TFood;
}

class Cat extends Pet {
  const type TFood = Fish;
}
```

Type constants are static, not per-instance. All instances of `Cat` have the same value for `TFood`, whereas `MyObject<T>` generics can differ between instances.

This enables type constants to be used outside the class, e.g. `Cat::TFood`.
