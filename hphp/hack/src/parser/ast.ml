(* id is stored without the $ *)
(* Pos is the span of the the variable definition. What does it mean exactly?
 * At first, one might think that in a definition like:
 *
 *   public ?string $foo = "aaaa";
 *
 * span of "foo" is entire line from the start of "public" to the semicolon
 * (excluded). This is not true though - what here is a single '$foo = "aaaa"'
 * is in fact a list, and "public string" applies to all of it's elements.
 * So it could be as well:
 *
 *  public ?string
 *    $foo = "aaaa",
 *    $bar = "cccc",
 *    $i_have_no_initializer;
 *
 * which makes it hard to include visibility and type into span of $bar
 * (since span is a single continuos range).
 * To make things more complicated, there are also XHP properties, with syntax:
 *
 *  attributes
 *    string xhp_prop = "aaa" @required,
 *    int other_xhp_prop;
 *
 * where each type and "@required" applies only to one property and could be
 * part of span.
 *
 * Moreover, there is also the case of implicit properties defined in
 * constructor:
 *
 *  public function __construct(
 *    public string $property,
 *  )
 *
 * The visibility, type and possible initializer are "per property", but
 * capturing their whole span is annoying from implementation point of view
 * - constructor is just a regular method in AST with special name, so we would
 * have to store additional data for every method argument just to use it in
 * this single case.
 *
 * The "lowest common denominator" of all those cases is to treat the property
 * extent as span of name + initializer, if present.
