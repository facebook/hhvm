(**
 * Consumes from stdout and stderr pipes and waitpids on the process.
 * Returns immediately if process has already been waited on (so this
 * function is idempotent).
 *
 * The implementation is a little complicated because:
 *   (1) The pipe can get filled up and the child process will pause
 *       until it's emptied out.
 *   (2) If the child process itself forks a grandchild, the
 *       granchild will unknowingly inherit the pipe's file descriptors;
 *       in this case, the pipe will not provide an EOF as you'd expect.
 *
 * Due to (1), we can't just blockingly waitpid followed by reading the
 * data from the pipe.
 *
 * Due to (2), we can't just read data from the pipes until an EOF is
 * reached and then do a waitpid.
 *
 * We must do some weird alternating between them.
