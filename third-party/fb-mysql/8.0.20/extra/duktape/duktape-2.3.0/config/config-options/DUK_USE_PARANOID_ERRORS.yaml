  When enabled, error messages won't involve summarization of keys or values.
  Summaries may be an issue in some security sensitive environments because
  error messages will include e.g. property keys.

  The default is to summarize offending base value and key for property access
  errors such as "null.foo = 123;", invalid calls such as "undefined()", etc.
  Base values and keys are summarized using duk_push_string_tval_readable().
