/**
 * API style guide.
 * ----------------
 *
 * These guides are to ensure we use consistent practices to make
 * our interface easy to use.
 * 1. Wrap the endpoint arguments in a struct. The name of this argument
 * struct should be the endpointname + "Request". This is Thrift's recommended
 * practice for arguments and ensures that we can safely evolve the arguments
 * of a method.
 * 2. Wrap the return value from the endpoint in a struct, even if it is just
 * a single value. This allows evolving return types without having to create a
 * whole new endpoint. The name of this return value struct should be
 * endpointname + "Response".
 * 3. If your endpoint operates on a mount(s), make the mount identifier
 * the first value in your arguments struct. Use the MountId struct as the type.
 * This allows us to evolve the identifiers we use for mountpoints in the future
 * without rewriting your new endpoint.
 */

/**
 * To support testing of the EdenFS client library, we need to be able to
 * mock the EdenFS Thrift APIs. This is done by defining a mock service,
 * using `mockall::mock!`, that implements the EdenFS Thrift APIs.
 *
 * The mock definitions will require updates whenever the EdenFS Thrift API
 * changes. Not all changes will require an update, only those that either:
 *   1. Add/Rename a new method to the interface
 *   2. Change the parameters or return type of a method
 *   3. Introduce a breaking Thrift API changes (e.g. rename a method)
 *
 * For reference, the EdenFS client library mocks are defined here:
