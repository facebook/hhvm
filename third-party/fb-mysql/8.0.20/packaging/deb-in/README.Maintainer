TODO: Why /bin/bash for some files and /bin/sh for others (this is also the case in native packaging, so might be a reason)
TODO: Related to above: Should be POSIX compliant
TODO: Build with -DWITH_SYSTEMD and related to use inbuilt systemd support (Deb8 and Ubuntu15+)
TODO: Maybe refactor CMakeLists.txt to remove redundancy
TODO: Clean up install exception list so --list-missing can be changed to --fail-missing
