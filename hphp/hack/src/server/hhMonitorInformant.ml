(**
 * The Revision tracker tracks the latest known SVN Revision of the repo,
 * the corresponding SVN revisions of Hg revisions, and the sequence of
 * revision changes (from hg update). See record type "env" below.
 *
 * This machinery is necessary because Watchman state change events give
 * us only the HG Revisions of hg updates, but we need to make decisions
 * on their SVN Revision numbers.
 *
 * We want to be able to:
 *  1) Determine when the base SVN revision (in trunk) has changed
 *     "significantly" so we can inform the server monitor to trigger
 *     a server restart (since incremental typechecks can be slower
 *     than a fresh server using a saved state).
 *  2) Fulfill goal 1 without blocking, and while being "highly responsive"
 *
 * The definition of "significant" can be adjusted according to how fast
 * incremental type checking is compared to a fresh restart.
 *
 * The meaning of "highly responsive" above roughly means using a cache
 * for SVN revisions (because a Mercurial request to get the SVN revision
 * number of an HG Revision is very slow, on the order of seconds).
 * Consider the following scenario:
 *
 *   Server is running with Repo at Revision 100. User does hg update to
 *   Rev 500 (which triggers a server restart) and works on that for
 *   an hour. Then the user hg updates back to Rev 100.
 *
 * At this point, the server restart should be triggered because we
 * are moving across hundreds of revisions. Without caching the Revision
 * 100 result, the restart would be delayed by seconds. With a cache, the
 * restart is triggered immediately.
 *)

     * processing at most one state change at a time. But consider the case
     * of many sequential hg updates, the last of which is very distant
     * (i.e. significant), and we happen to have a cached value only for
     * the last hg update.
     *
     * If we processed one-at-a-time as the updates came in, it would be many
     * seconds of processing each hg query before deciding at the final one
     * to restart the server (so the server restart is delayed by many
     * seconds).
     *
     * By keeping a running queue of state changes and "preprocessing" new
     * changes from the watchman subscription (before appending them to this
     * queue), we can catch that final hg update early on and proactively
     * trigger a server restart.
