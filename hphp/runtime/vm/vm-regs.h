/*
 * This file contains accessors for the three primary VM registers:
 *
 * vmpc(): PC pointing to the currently executing bytecode instruction
 * vmfp(): ActRec* pointing to the current frame
 * vmsp(): Cell* pointing to the top of the eval stack
 *
 * The registers are physically located in the RDS header struct (defined in
 * runtime/base/rds-header.h), allowing efficient access from translated code
 * when needed. They are generally not kept up-to-date in translated code,
 * though, so there are times when it is not safe to use them. This is tracked
 * in the tl_regState variable, which is automatically checked in the accessors
 * defined here. Certain parts of the runtime do need access to the registers
 * while their state is expected to be dirty; the vmRegsUnsafe() function is
 * provided for these rare cases.
 *
 * In a C++ function potentially called from translated code, VMRegAnchor
 * should be used before accessing any of these registers. jit::FixupMap is
 * currently responsible for doing the work required to sync the VM registers,
 * though this is an implementation detail and should not matter to users of
 * VMRegAnchor.

 * them (by traversing the stack and looking up fixups)---this is what the
 * value of tl_regState should be whenever we enter native code from translated
 * PHP code.
 *
 * Values above GUARDED_THRESHOLD are a special case of dirty which indicates
 * that the state will be reset to DIRTY (via a scope guard) when returning to
 * PHP code, and the actual value can be used as a start point for following the
 * c++ callchain back into the VM. This makes it suitable for guarding callbacks
 * through code compiled without frame pointers, and in places where we may
 * end up needing to clean the registers multiple times.

 * assert or crash if it attempts to parse a part of the stack with no frame
 * pointers. VMRegAnchor forces the stack traversal to be done when it is
 * constructed.
 *
 * A VMRegAnchor in "soft" mode will look for stashed VM metadata and only sync
 * VM state if it finds it.  (The default behavior is "hard" mode, where we
 * assert if we don't find the fixup state).
