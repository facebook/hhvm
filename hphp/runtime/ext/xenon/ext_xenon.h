                        Project Xenon
  What is it?
  The name Xenon is from the type of bulb used in strobelights.  The idea is
  that a timer goes off and the code takes a snapshot of the combined stack
  stack at that time (ie it flashes the code).

  How does it work?
  There are two ways for Xenon to work: 1) always on, 2) via timer. For the
  timer mode: Xenon starts a timer that raises SIGPROF periodically. When that
  timer fires it sets a semaphore so that others may know. We'd like to be able
  to record the status of every stack for every thread at this point, but during
  a timer handler is not a reasonable place to do this.
  Instead, Xenon has a pthread waiting for the semaphore.  When the semaphore
  is set in the handler, it wakes, sets the Xenon Surprise flag for every
  thread - this is the flash.
  There is a mechanism that hooks the enter/exit of every PHP function,
  using the Surprise flags leverages that mechanism and calls logging.
  At this point, if the flag is set for this thread, the PHP and async stack
  will be logged for that thread.

  The for the always on mode:  when execute_command_line_begin is called,
  all of the threads are Surprised.  When the Xenon methods are invoked in
  this mode, the Xenon Surprise flags are not cleared, so functions will always
  be Surprised on enter and exit.  In this mode, no threads or semaphores or
  timers are created, since they are not needed.

  How do I use it?
  Enabling it via Xenon Period runtime option will start Xenon snapping and
  gathering data.  There is a PHP extension, xenon_get_data, that returns
  all of the data gather for that request/thread.  Period is a double that
  represents seconds (ie 0.1 is a ten of a second).
  Once can alternatively set Xenon ForceAlways=true, which will then
  gather combined stacks at every function enter/exit.  This will
  gather potentially large amounts of data - mostly used for small
  script debugging.
