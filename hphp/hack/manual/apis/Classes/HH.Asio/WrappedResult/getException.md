:::info[Note]
This is a point-in-time snapshot of the API documentation from January 2026.
Going forward, we will not be maintaining a public copy of these references,
and recommend users to refer to the built-in signature helpers available in
the Hack LSP instead for complete and up-to-date information.
:::

Since this is a successful result wrapper, this always returns an
[` InvariantException `](/apis/Classes/HH/InvariantException/) saying that there was no exception thrown from
the [` Awaitable `](/apis/Classes/HH/Awaitable/) operation




``` Hack
public function getException(): Exception;
```




## Returns




+ ` Exception ` - An [` InvariantException `](/apis/Classes/HH/InvariantException/).
