/*
 * TC Reuse Module
 *
 * This module implements garbage collection for the translation cache so that
 * unreachable translations may be overridden by new translations.
 *
 * Unreachable translations are created by either:
 *  (1) Freeing a function through the treadmill
 *  (2) Replacing profiling translations in a SrcRec
 *
 * SrcRecs and prologues are recorded as they are emitted in to the TC so that
 * when their associated function becomes unreachable they may be freed. In the
 * case of profiling translations, these are sometimes freed eagerly when they
 * become unreachable, as they will be erased from their associated SrcRec and
 * are not tracked elsewhere.
 *
 * Function callers and inter-translation jumps are recorded so that they may
 * be smashed when space is reclaimed with the TC.
 *
 * Freed memory is tracked and allocated using the policy defined in DataBlock,
 * and allocation is performed in MCGenerator following the creation of a new
 * translation.
 *
 * Rather than emit new translations directly into freed memory they are written
 * at the end of the TC and then relocated into freed memory. As the space
 * required for a translation will be unknown until it is complete this strategy
 * allows allocation of an appropriately sized block.
 *
 * Currently all allocation and deallocation is done eagerly, therefore the
 * performance of the module is dependent on accurately detecting unreachable
 * functions and translations.
 *
 * This module exports diagnostic data in the form of counts of smashed calls
 * and branches, and recorded functions. Higher level diagnostic data exported
 * by DataBlock may be of more use in tracking TC health. In particular, the
 * number of free bytes and free blocks give a rough measure of fragmentation
 * within the allocator.
 *
 * See DataBlock for details about the allocation strategy and free memory
 * tracking.
