description: >
  Maximum value stack size.  If value stack is about to be grown beyond this
  size (the check includes a possible spare so the check isn't exact) reject
  the resize.  The limit must be low enough so that when multiplied by
  sizeof(duk_tval), typically 8 or 16, the multiplication won't overflow
  size_t.
