/**
 * Stats exporting scheduler that allows work to be scheduled on virtual threads. These threads are
 * managed by the JVM's internal ForkJoinPool and tasks are executed on its carrier threads. Tasks
 * will never be rejected as this scheduler does not throw exceptions when submitting tasks. Tasks
 * that are not immediately runnable are queued for execution using the ThreadPerTaskExecutor.
 * Virtual threads will be created and will wait to run until there is an available carrier thread.
 * This allows for high scalability but may consume additional memory under high load.
 *
 * <p>Notes:
 *
 * <p>These virtual threads are managed by the JVM's internal ForkJoinPool. There are three
 * configurations options that allow you to configure the properties of this ForkJoinPool: max
 * parallelism, pool size and min runnable threads.
 *
 * <pre>
 *    -Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.parallelism
 *    -Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.maxPoolSize
 *    -Djdk.virtualThreadScheduler.minRunnable
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Keep in mind that these settings affect the entire JVM and all virtual threads whether they
 * were scheduled on this scheduler or not.
 *
 * <p>The VirtualThreadScheduler can be configured with the following flags:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     (boolean) -Dthrift.virtual-thread-scheduler
 *     (boolean)-Dthrift.virtual-thread-limit-concurrency
 *     (int) -Dthrift.virtual-thread-max-concurrency
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>set thrift.virtual-thread-scheduler to "true" to enable the virtual thread scheduler, this
 * will disable any other ForkJoin/ThreadPool schedulers. If you wish to limit concurrency set
 * thrift.virtual-thread-limit-concurrency to true and then set
 * thrift.virtual-thread-max-concurrency to the max number of concurrent tasks. The low level
 * implementation uses a Semaphore (with strict fairness) to gate the execution of the underlying
 * runnable. This means that regardless of how many carrier threads are available only N tasks will
 * run in parallel, where N = maxConcurrency. All other virtual threads will be queued in memory
 * until a lock can be acquired.
 *
 * <p>If you do not wish to limit concurrency do not set virtual-thread-limit-concurrency and the OS
 * will limit concurrency based on JVM settings and internal ForkJoinPool, typically
 * Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()
 *
 * <p>Considerations: Be cautious when limiting concurrency. Virtual threads can become pinned to
 * carrier thread and starve the application of resources in certain circumstances. Instances where
 * virtual threads can become pinned are long-running or CPU intensive tasks, synchronized blocks
 * and JNI/FFI api calls. Virtual threads cannot yield if they do not block meaning they will
 * consume the CPU available until they complete. The synchronized keyword is also not compatible
 * with virtual threads at this time and yielding will fail on blocking calls inside synchronized
 * blocks. Avoid this at all cost, consider using ReentrantLock or other java concurrent mechanisms.
 * Virtual threads will also become pinned during any native calls either JNI or FFI calls.
 *
 * <p>Other considerations include avoiding ThreadLocals if they consume a lot of memory or are
 * costly to construct. Thread locals will be created for every instance of a Virtual thread and
 * will consume memory. Consider using ScopedValues if you need to propagate context between calls
 * in the virtual thread or consider using a shared resource pool if you want to avoid creating
 * expensive or large high memory objects that need to be used across threads.
