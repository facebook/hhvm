This method is declared as `__NeedsConcrete` but overrides a non-`__NeedsConcrete` method. Please add `__NeedsConcrete` to the overridden method or remove it from the current method. (The `__NeedsConcrete` attribute indicates that a method requires `static` to point to a concrete class) (Warn[12027])
  File "needs_concrete_override_1.php", line 9, characters 19-21:
  It is unsafe to declare this method as `__NeedsConcrete`, since it overrides a non-`__NeedsConcrete` method
