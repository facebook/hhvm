__AllowMultipleInstantiations
  INSERT __AllowMultipleInstantiations
  built-in attribute
  Allows implementing this interface with multiple instantiations, e.g. `implements I<int>, I<string>`
__ConsistentConstruct
  INSERT __ConsistentConstruct
  built-in attribute
  Requires all child classes to have the same constructor signature.  This allows `new static(...)` and `new $the_class_name(...)`.
__Docs
  INSERT __Docs
  built-in attribute
  Shows the linked URL when hovering over this type.
__DynamicallyConstructible
  INSERT __DynamicallyConstructible
  built-in attribute
  Allows this class to be instantiated dynamically, based on a string of its name. HHVM will warn or error (depending on settings) on dynamic instantiations without this attribute.
__DynamicallyReferenced
  INSERT __DynamicallyReferenced
  built-in attribute
  Allows a user to get a pointer to this class from a string of its name. HHVM will warn or error (depending on settings) on dynamic references without this attribute.
__EnableMethodTraitDiamond
  INSERT __EnableMethodTraitDiamond
  built-in attribute
  Allows a trait to be `use`d more than once. This is useful in large class hierarchies, where you can end up using the same trait on via multiple paths, producing 'diamond inheritance'.
  
  This requires methods to unambiguous: each method definition must occur in exactly one trait.
__Sealed
  INSERT __Sealed
  built-in attribute
  Only the named classes can extend this class or interface. Child classes may still be extended unless they are marked `final`.
