/**
  @file composite_iterators.h

  A composite row iterator is one that takes in one or more existing iterators
  and processes their rows in some interesting way. They are usually not bound
  to a single table or similar, but are the inner (non-leaf) nodes of the
  iterator execution tree. They consistently own their source iterator, although
  not its memory (since we never allocate row iterators on the heap--usually on
  a MEM_ROOT>). This means that in the end, you'll end up with a single root
  iterator which then owns everything else recursively.

  SortingIterator is also a composite iterator, but is defined in its own file.

  Handles aggregation (typically used for GROUP BY) for the case where the rows
  are already properly grouped coming in, ie., all rows that are supposed to be
  part of the same group are adjacent in the input stream. (This could be
  because they were sorted earlier, because we are scanning an index that
  already gives us the rows in a group-compatible order, or because there is no
  grouping.)

  AggregateIterator is special in that it's one of the very few row iterators
  that actually change the shape of the rows; some columns are dropped as part
  of aggregation, others (the aggregates) are added. For this reason (and also
  because we need to make copies of the group expressions -- see Read()), it
  conceptually always outputs to a temporary table. If we _are_ outputting to a
  temporary table, that's not a problem --Â we take over responsibility for
  copying the group expressions from MaterializeIterator, which would otherwise
  do it.

  However, if we are outputting directly to the user, we need somewhere to store
  the output. This is solved by abusing the slice system; since we only need to
  buffer a single row, we can set up just enough items in the
  REF_SLICE_ORDERED_GROUP_BY slice, so that it can hold a single row. This row
  is then used for our output, and we then switch to it just before the end of
  Read() so that anyone reading from the buffers will get that output.
  The caller knows the context about where our output goes, and thus also picks
  the appropriate output slice for us.

  This isn't very pretty. What should be done is probably a more abstract
  concept of sending a row around and taking copies of it if needed, as opposed
  to it implicitly staying in the table's buffer. (This would also solve some
  issues in EQRefIterator and when synthesizing NULL rows for outer joins.)
  However, that's a large refactoring.

  Handles materialization; the first call to Init() will scan the given iterator
  to the end, store the results in a temporary table (optionally with
  deduplication), and then Read() will allow you to read that table repeatedly
  without the cost of executing the given subquery many times (unless you ask
  for rematerialization).

  When materializing, MaterializeIterator takes care of evaluating any items
  that need so, and storing the results in the fields of the outgoing table --
  which items is governed by the temporary table parameters.

  Conceptually (although not performance-wise!), the MaterializeIterator is a
  no-op if you don't ask for deduplication, and in some cases (e.g. when
  scanning a table only once), we elide it. However, it's not necessarily
  straightforward to do so by just not inserting the iterator, as the optimizer
  will have set up everything (e.g., read sets, or what table upstream items
  will read from) assuming the materialization will happen, so the realistic
  option is setting up everything as if materialization would happen but not
  actually write to the table; see StreamingIterator for details.

  MaterializeIterator conceptually materializes iterators, not JOINs or
  SELECT_LEX_UNITs. However, there are many details that leak out
  (e.g., setting performance schema batch mode, slices, reusing CTEs,
  etc.), so we need to send them in anyway.

    @param unit The query expression we are materializing (see m_unit).
    @param join
      When materializing within the same JOIN (e.g., into a temporary table
      before sorting), as opposed to a derived table or a CTE, we may need
      to change the slice on the join before returning rows from the result
      table. If so, join and ref_slice would need to be set, and
      query_blocks_to_materialize should contain only one member, with the same
      join.
    @param ref_slice See join. If we are materializing across JOINs,
      e.g. derived tables, ref_slice should be left at -1.
    @param copy_fields_and_items If set to false, the Field objects in the
      output row are presumed already to be filled out. This is the case iff
      there's an AggregateIterator earlier in the chain.
    @param rematerialize true if rematerializing on every Init() call
      (e.g., because we have a dependency on a value from outside the query
      block).
    @param limit_rows See limit_rows on the other constructor.

  Like semijoin materialization, weedout works on the basic idea that a semijoin
  is just like an inner join as we long as we can get rid of the duplicates
  somehow. (This is advantageous, because inner joins can be reordered, whereas
  semijoins generally can't.) However, unlike semijoin materialization, weedout
  removes duplicates after the join, not before it. Consider something like

    SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE a IN ( SELECT b FROM t2 );

  Semijoin materialization solves this by materializing t2, with deduplication,
  and then joining. Weedout joins t1 to t2 and then leaves only one output row
  per t1 row. The disadvantage is that this potentially needs to discard more
  rows; the (potential) advantage is that we deduplicate on t1 instead of t2.

  Weedout, unlike materialization, works in a streaming fashion; rows are output
  (or discarded) as they come in, with a temporary table used for recording the
  row IDs we've seen before. (We need to deduplicate on t1's row IDs, not its
  contents.) See SJ_TMP_TABLE for details about the table format.

  An iterator that is semantically equivalent to a semijoin NestedLoopIterator
  immediately followed by a RemoveDuplicatesIterator. It is used to implement
  the âloose scanâ strategy in queries with multiple tables on the inside of a
  semijoin, like

    ... FROM t1 WHERE ... IN ( SELECT ... FROM t2 JOIN t3 ... )

  In this case, the query tree without this iterator would ostensibly look like

    -> Nested loop join
       -> Table scan on t1
       -> Remove duplicates on t2_idx
          -> Nested loop semijoin
             -> Index scan on t2 using t2_idx
             -> Filter (e.g. t3.a = t2.a)
                -> Table scan on t3

  (t3 will be marked as âfirst matchâ on t2 when implementing loose scan,
  thus the semijoin.)

  First note that we can't put the duplicate removal directly on t2 in this
  case, as the first t2 row doesn't necessarily match anything in t3, so it
  needs to be above. However, this is wasteful, because once we find a matching
  t2/t3 pair, we should stop scanning t3 until we have a new t2.

  NestedLoopSemiJoinWithDuplicateRemovalIterator solves the problem by doing
  exactly this; it gets a row from the outer side, gets exactly one row from the
  inner side, and then skips over rows from the outer side (_without_ scanning
  the inner side) until its keypart changes.
