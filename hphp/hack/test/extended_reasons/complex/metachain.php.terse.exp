Expected `string`

File "metachain.php", line 22, character 17 - line 22, character 22:

But got `dynamic`

File "metachain.php", line 7, character 10 - line 10, character 3:

 6 | ): Awaitable<void> {
 7 |   $foo = »await genX(
 8 |     // ReproMetaChain::fromValue(shape()) instead of $val
 9 |     $val->then($obj),
10 |   );«
11 |   list($_, $user_prompt) = $foo;
12 |   //$user_prompt = $foo[1];

Here's why:

I checked the subtype constraint in [Main] because it was implied by the other constraints on the type variable.

Main

[Main] Step 1 of 2

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this expression

File "metachain.php", line 7, character 10 - line 10, character 3:

 6 | ): Awaitable<void> {
 7 |   $foo = »await genX(
 8 |     // ReproMetaChain::fromValue(shape()) instead of $val
 9 |     $val->then($obj),
10 |   );«
11 |   list($_, $user_prompt) = $foo;
12 |   //$user_prompt = $foo[1];

which I solved to this expression

File "metachain.php", line 7, character 10 - line 10, character 3:

 6 | ): Awaitable<void> {
 7 |   $foo = »await genX(
 8 |     // ReproMetaChain::fromValue(shape()) instead of $val
 9 |     $val->then($obj),
10 |   );«
11 |   list($_, $user_prompt) = $foo;
12 |   //$user_prompt = $foo[1];

and flows into this expression via an assignment

File "metachain.php", line 11, character 28 - line 11, character 31:

 10 |   );
 11 |   list($_, $user_prompt) = »$foo«;
 12 |   //$user_prompt = $foo[1];
 13 |   $s = shape(

The supertype comes from this hint

File "metachain.php", line 22, character 17 - line 22, character 22:

 21 |   const type TInput = shape(
 22 |     'prompt' => »string«,
 23 |   );
 24 | }

[Main] Step 2 of 2 (here is where the error occurred)

The subtype is a union type so next I checked the subtype constraint is satisfied for all its elements.

The subtype comes from this expression

File "metachain.php", line 7, character 10 - line 10, character 3:

 6 | ): Awaitable<void> {
 7 |   $foo = »await genX(
 8 |     // ReproMetaChain::fromValue(shape()) instead of $val
 9 |     $val->then($obj),
10 |   );«
11 |   list($_, $user_prompt) = $foo;
12 |   //$user_prompt = $foo[1];

The supertype is the same as before.

File "metachain.php", line 22, character 17 - line 22, character 22:

 21 |   const type TInput = shape(
 22 |     'prompt' => »string«,
 23 |   );
 24 | }
