#  YAML is used because it diffs well and has clean support for multiline

description: >
  Use a 16-bit object entry and array part sizes (for low memory
  environments).  Also automatically drops support for an object hash
  part to further reduce memory usage; there are rarely large objects
  in low memory environments simply because there's no memory to store
  a lot of properties.

  By default use "description: >" markup which works well for paragraphs
  (replacing newlines with spaces) but includes a trailing newline which
  is also a good default.
