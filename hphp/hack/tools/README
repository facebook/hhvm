hackificator and remove_soft_types
==================================

These refactoring and conversion tools are based on pfff instead of the core
hh_server code due to pfff's superior support for parsing, modifying, and then
unparsing PHP code. However, this makes them more annoying to build.

To install:

1) Install OPAM (https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html)
   Don't forget to run "opam init"
   Don't forget to run "eval `opam config env`"
2) Install pfff (opam install pfff)
   Note: You may need to switch to an older version of ocaml
   You can do this with `opam switch 4.01.0`
3) For each tool you want:
   cd $TOOL
   make clean && make depend && make
3) Binaries are installed at hack/bin/tools, where hack is the directory for
   this repo


augmented_types
===============

Converts Box's "augmented types" into Hack types. See
https://github.com/box/augmented_types/wiki/The-Type-System for the AT spec.
