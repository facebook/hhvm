WARN: File "await_preserves_nullability.php", line 21, characters 9-13:
This is a sketchy null check on an expression of type T.
It detects nulls, but it will also detect many other falsy values, including `false`, `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `"0"`, empty Containers, and more.
If you want to test for them, please consider doing so explicitly.
If you only meant to test for `null`, use `$item is nonnull` instead (Warn[12003])
WARN: File "await_preserves_nullability.php", line 21, characters 9-13:
`$item` is a sketchy condition: testing the truthiness of an array key (int | string) may not behave as expected.
The values `0`, `""`, and `"0"` are all considered falsy. Test for them explicitly. (Warn[12006])
