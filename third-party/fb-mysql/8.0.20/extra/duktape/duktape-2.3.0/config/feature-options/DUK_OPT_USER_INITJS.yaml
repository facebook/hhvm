description: >
  Provide a string to evaluate when a thread with new built-ins (a new global
  environment) is created.  This allows you to make minor modifications to the
  global environment before any code is executed in it.  The value must be a
  string, e.g.:: -DDUK_OPT_USER_INITJS='"this.foo = 123"'.

  Errors in the initialization code result in a fatal error.
