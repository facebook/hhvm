description: >
  Disable support for function declarations outside program or function top
  level (also known as "function statements").  Such declarations are
  non-standard and the strictly compliant behavior is to treat them as a
  SyntaxError.  Default behavior is to treat them like ordinary function
  declarations ("hoist" them to function top) with V8-like semantics.
