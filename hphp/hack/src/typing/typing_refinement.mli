(**
  Given a [Typing_defs.locl_ty] and a [Typing_defs.type_predicate], partition the
  [Typing_defs.locl_ty] into three types:

    left: For the portition of the type that is a subset of the values that
      passes the predicate at runtime

    right: For the portition of the type that is a subset of the values that
      fails the predicate at runtime

    span: For the portition of the type that contains values that both
      pass and fails the predicate

  As an example consider partition the type (num | arraykey | T) where T is a generic type
    bounded by nonnull over the predicate (IsTag IntTag)

  This will produce
    left = int (num & (IsTag IntTag) = int and arraykey & (IsTag IntTag) = int)
    right = float | string (num & !(IsTag IntTag) = float and arraykey & !(IsTag IntTag) = string)
    span = T (T can contain values that are ints and values that are not ints)
