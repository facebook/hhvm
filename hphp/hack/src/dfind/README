dfind is a tool to quickly find what has changed in a directory.
It's a "difference finder".
The way it works

$ dfind your_directory your_handle

On the first call, it will give you all the files in this directory.

If you call dfind again with the same directory and the same handle,
it will only print the files that have changed.

Note that you can do: dfind -f, if you want to get the differences incrementally.

What happens under the hood:
If you are the first one to call dfind, it forks, and creates a server.
The dfind server is shared accross all the users of the machine.
You can find the log in /tmp/dfind.log and the pid in /tmp/dfind.pid

NOTE: dfind is very dumb, and very conservative. It can give you MORE files that what has actually changed. But it will never give you less (unless there is a bug). The idea is to use dfind to narrow down the results, not to give and accurate view of the current state of the world.
