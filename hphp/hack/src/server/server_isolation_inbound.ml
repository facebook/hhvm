(* Budget for the walk, in dep hashes rather than the files the caller bounds.
   Firing early can refuse a closure that would have fitted, never return an
   incomplete one. The floor matters because growth clamps [max] to the cluster
   cap, which alone would put the budget below closures that do fit.

   Neither figure is measured. Twenty hashes per permitted file is a guess at
   what a Hack file defines, and the floor is a round number above the closures
   a run actually returns. Both err towards refusing, so setting either too low
   costs recall — a lower isolatability figure — and never a wrong closure. *)

(* [add_all_deps] chains these two but cannot be used here: it returns its input,
