  A runtime type mismatch on this parameter/property will not throw a TypeError/Error. This is useful for migrating partial code where you're unsure about the type.
  
  The type checker will ignore this attribute, so your code will still get type checked. If the type is wrong at runtime, a warning will be logged and code execution will continue.
