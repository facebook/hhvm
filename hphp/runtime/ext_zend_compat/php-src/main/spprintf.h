/*

The pbuf parameter of all spprintf version receives a pointer to the allocated
buffer. This buffer must be freed manually after usage using efree() function.
The buffer will always be terminated by a zero character. When pbuf is NULL
the function can be used to calculate the required size of the buffer but for
that purpose snprintf is faster. When both pbuf and the return value are 0
than you are out of memory.

There is also snprintf: See difference explained in snprintf.h
