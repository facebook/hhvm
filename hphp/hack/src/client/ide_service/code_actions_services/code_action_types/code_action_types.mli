     `to_string` produces "as useful as possible" Hack source code:
         - fully expand types
         - avoid truncating types (especially important for nested shapes)
         - *do* emit non-denotable types like unions. Then we can at least give the user a starting-point for
         writing source code: a single union in a shape type shouldn't prevent us from providing most of the shape type for the user.
