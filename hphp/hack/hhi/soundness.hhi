/**
 * `UNSAFE_CAST` allows you to lie to the type checker. **This is almost
 * always a bad idea**. You might get an exception, or you might get an
 * unexpected value. Even scarier, you might cause an exception in a
 * totally different part of the codebase.
 *
 * ```
 * UNSAFE_CAST<Dog, Cat>($my_dog, 'my reason here')->meow()
 * ```
 *
 * In this example, the type checker will accept the code, but the code
 * will still crash when you run it (no such method "meow" on "Dog").
 *
 * `UNSAFE_CAST` has no runtime effect. It only affects the type
 * checker. The above example will run the same as `$my_dog->meow()`.
 *
 * ## You can fix it!
 *
 * It is always possible to write code without `UNSAFE_CAST` and without
 * `HH_FIXME`. This usually requires changing type signatures and some
 * refactoring. Your code will be more reliable, the type checker can
 * help you, and future changes will be less scary.
 *
 * `UNSAFE_CAST` is still better than `HH_FIXME`, because `HH_FIXME`
 * applies to the entire next line, and `UNSAFE_CAST` applies to a single
 * expression.
