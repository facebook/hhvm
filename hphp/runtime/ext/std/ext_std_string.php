/* Output a formatted string
 *
 * @param mixed $format - The format string is composed of
 * zero or more directives: ordinary characters (excluding %)
 * that are copied directly to the result, and conversion specifications,
 * each of which results in fetching its own parameter.
 * This applies to both sprintf() and printf().
 *
 * Each conversion specification consists of a percent sign (%),
 * followed by one or more of these elements, in order:
 *
 * An optional sign specifier that forces a sign (- or +) to
 * be used on a number. By default, only the - sign is used
 * on a number if it's negative. This specifier forces positive
 * numbers to have the + sign attached as well,
 * and was added in PHP 4.3.0.
 *
 * An optional padding specifier that says what character will
 * be used for padding the results to the right string size.
 * This may be a space character or a 0 (zero character).
 * The default is to pad with spaces. An alternate padding character
 * can be specified by prefixing it with a single quote (').
 * See the examples below.
 *
 * An optional alignment specifier that says if the result should
 * be left-justified or right-justified. The default is right-justified;
 * a - character here will make it left-justified.
 *
 * An optional number, a width specifier that says how many characters
 * (minimum) this conversion should result in.
 *
 * An optional precision specifier in the form of a period (`.')
 * followed by an optional decimal digit string that says how many
 * decimal digits should be displayed for floating-point numbers.
 * When using this specifier on a string, it acts as a cutoff point,
 * setting a maximum character limit to the string.
 *
 * A type specifier that says what type the argument data should be
 * treated as. Possible types:
 *
 * % - a literal percent character. No argument is required.
 * b - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a binary number.
 * c - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as the
 *     character with that ASCII value.
 * d - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as a
 *     (signed) decimal number.
 * e - the argument is treated as scientific notation (e.g. 1.2e+2).
 *     The precision specifier stands for the number of digits after
 *     the decimal point since PHP 5.2.1. In earlier versions, it
 *     was taken as number of significant digits (one less).
 * E - like %e but uses uppercase letter (e.g. 1.2E+2).
 * f - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as
 *     a floating-point number (locale aware).
 * F - the argument is treated as a float, and presented as
 *     a floating-point number (non-locale aware).
 *     Available since PHP 4.3.10 and PHP 5.0.3.
 * g - shorter of %e and %f.
 * G - shorter of %E and %f.
 * o - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as an octal number.
 * s - the argument is treated as and presented as a string.
 * u - the argument is treated as an integer, and presented as
 *     an unsigned decimal number.
 * x - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a
 *      hexadecimal number (with lowercase letters).
 * X - the argument is treated as an integer and presented as a
 *      hexadecimal number (with uppercase letters).
 *
 * Variables will be co-erced to a suitable type for the specifier:
