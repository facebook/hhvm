 * x86 terminology review: "Virtual addresses" are subject to both segmented
 * translation and paged translation.  "Linear addresses" are post-segmentation
 * address, subject only to paging.  C and C++ generally only have access to
 * bitwise linear addresses.
 *
 * On Linux, TLS data live at negative virtual addresses off FS: the first
 * datum is typically at VA(FS:-sizeof(datum)).  Linux's x64 ABI stores the
 * linear address of the base of TLS at VA(FS:0).  While this is just a
 * convention, it is firm: gcc builds binaries that assume it when, e.g.,
 * evaluating "&myTlsDatum".
 *
 * The virtual addresses of TLS data are not exposed to C/C++.  To figure it
 * out, we take a datum's linear address, and subtract it from the linear
 * address where TLS starts.

/*
 * In MacOS an __thread variable has a "key" allocated in global memory, under
 * the name of the object.  The key consists of three longs.  The first holds
 * the address of a function, which if called with $rdi pointing at the key
 * (i.e., $rdi = &key; call 0x0($rdi)) will return the address of the thread
 * local (possibly allocating it, if this is the first time its been accessed
 * in the current thread).
 *
 * The function is very short (in the case that the thread local has already
 * been allocated), and preserves all the registers except for $rax (which gets
 * the address of the thread local)---so we could just use it to access the
 * thread locals.  But we can do better.
 *
 * The second long contains a gs-relative index to a pointer to the block of
 * memory containing the thread-local, and the third long contains the offset
 * to it within that block.  So if $rdi points at the key,
 *
 *  movq 8($rdi), $rax
 *  movq gs:(,$rax,8), $rax
 *  addq 16($rdi), $rax
 *
 * will get us the address of the thread local.
 *
 * But we can still do better.  key[1] and key[2] are constants for the
 * duration of the program; so we can burn their values into the tc:
 *
 *  movq gs:{key[1]*8}, $rax
 *  addq {key[2]}, $rax
 *
 * But note that the add will often fold into a following load or store.
 *
 * So the only remaining problem is to get the address of the key:
 *
 *   __asm__("lea %1, %0" : "=r"(ret) : "m"(tlvar));
 *
 * Unfortunately, clang is too smart here, and converts the lea into:
 *
 *  lea _tlvar, $rdi
 *  call ($rdi)
 *  move $rax, ret
 *
 * Fortunately, the helper preserves all regs (except $rax), and so $rdi now
 * has the address of the key.  We use that trick in the OSX version of
 * tls_datum().
 *
 * Finally note that all of this is only valid if the thread local has already
 * been accessed in the current thread---but we can easily ensure that (it's
 * already true for any ThreadLocalNoCheck variable).
