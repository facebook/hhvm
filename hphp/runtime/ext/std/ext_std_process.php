 * @param array $descriptorspec - An indexed array where the key represents
 *   the descriptor number and the value represents how PHP will pass that
 *   descriptor to the child process. 0 is stdin, 1 is stdout, while 2 is
 *   stderr.  Each element can be: An array describing the pipe to pass to the

 *   an option for the given type. Valid types are pipe (the second element is
 *   either r to pass the read end of the pipe to the process, or w to pass the
 *   write end) and file (the second element is a filename). A stream resource
 *   representing a real file descriptor (e.g. opened file, a socket, STDIN).
 *   The file descriptor numbers are not limited to 0, 1 and 2 - you may specify
 *   any valid file descriptor number and it will be passed to the child
 *   process. This allows your script to interoperate with other scripts that
 *   run as "co-processes". In particular, this is useful for passing
 *   passphrases to programs like PGP, GPG and openssl in a more secure manner.
 *   It is also useful for reading status information provided by those programs
 *   on auxiliary file descriptors.
 * @param mixed $pipes - Will be set to an indexed array of file pointers that
 *   correspond to PHP's end of any pipes that are created.
 * @param string $cwd - The initial working dir for the command. This must be
 *   an absolute directory path, or NULL if you want to use the default value
 *   (the working dir of the current PHP process)
 * @param mixed $env - An array with the environment variables for the command
 *   that will be run, or NULL to use the same environment as the current PHP
 *   process
 * @param mixed $other_options - Allows you to specify additional options.
 *   Currently supported options include: suppress_errors (windows only):
 *   suppresses errors generated by this function when it's set to TRUE
 *   bypass_shell (windows only): bypass cmd.exe shell when set to TRUE context:
 *   stream context used when opening files (created with
 *   stream_context_create()) binary_pipes: open pipes in binary mode, instead
 *   of using the usual stream_encoding
 *
 * @return mixed - Returns a resource representing the process, which should
 *   be freed using proc_close() when you are finished with it. On failure
 *   returns FALSE.
