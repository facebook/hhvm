Python wrappers of the structs defined in the services files. This file is
compiled into it's own module to be included by clients and services and
end-user code. It's one of the more complicated files, as it has to map
Pythonic APIs to C++ objects and back.

One of the nastier things in this file is the definition of containers.
A separate container wrapper has to be defined for each type of contained
attribute because Cython can't template C++ classes. So, for example, we need
a List__int16 or a List__string or a Map__string_mystruct instance for each
container/type combination. Consider that containers can contain other containers
or structs that contain containers and you realize how messy this can get.
Further, we'd prefer to have the end user freed from having to know about these
container types, so we'll need to define factories for them based on what they
want to include.
