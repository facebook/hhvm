(*****************************************************************************)
(* Builds a substitution out of a list of type parameters and a list of types.
 *
 * Typical use-case:
 *   class Y<T> { ... }
 *   class X extends Y<int>
 *
 * To build the type of X, we need to replace all the occurrences of T in Y by
 * int. The function make_subst, builds the substitution (the map associating
 * types to a type parameter name), in this case, it would build the map(T =>
 * int).
