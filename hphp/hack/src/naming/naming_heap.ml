(* ClassStatus is something that we want to be able to access very quickly.
 * Workers in the "declaration" phase need to be able to know if their parent
 * class has already been declared or not.
 * They will lookup the status of a class (declared, error, or todo) very
 * frequently.
 * That's why we are dissociating ClassStatus from ClassHeap.
 * If the status of the class was in ClassHeap, we would have to deserialize
 * a tree every time a parent class has been successfully declared.
 * It would be horribly slow.
 * Using a cache is not an option since the class status are updated
 * concurrently.
