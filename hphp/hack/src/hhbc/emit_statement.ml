  (4) the exceptional-continuation fault body.

  (* (1) Try body

  The try body might have un-rewritten continues and breaks which
  branch to a label outside of the try. This means that we must
  first run the normal-continuation finally, and then branch to the
  appropriate label.

  We do this by running a rewriter which turns continues and breaks
  inside the try body into setting temp_local to an integer which indicates
  what action the finally must perform when it is finished, followed by a
  jump directly to the finally.

  (* (2) Finally body

  Note that this is used both in the normal-continuation and
  exceptional-continuation cases; we generate the same code twice.

  TODO: We might consider changing the codegen so that the finally block
  is only generated once. We could do this by making the fault block set a
  temp local to -1, and then branch to the finally block. In the finally block
  epilogue it can check to see if the local is -1, and if so, issue an unwind
  instruction.

  It is illegal to have a continue or break which branches out of a finally.
  Unfortunately we at present do not detect this at parse time; rather, we
  generate an exception at run-time by rewriting continue and break
  instructions found inside finally blocks.

  TODO: If we make this illegal at parse time then we can remove this pass.

  (* (4) Fault body

  We now emit the fault body; it is just cleanup code for the temp_local,
  a copy of the finally body (without the branching epilogue, since we are
  going to unwind rather than branch), and an unwind instruction.

  TODO: The HHVM emitter sometimes emits seemingly spurious
  unset-unnamed-local instructions into the fault block.  These look
  like bugs in the emitter. Investigate; if they are bugs in the HHVM
  emitter, get them fixed there. If not, get a clear explanation of
  what they are for and why they are required.
