 * 2.  Stack underflow & overflow not allowed.
 * 3.  Empty stack at try-region starts (but not ends).
 * 4.  |stack| == 1 before Ret*.
 * 5.  The body must end with a terminal.
 * 6.  State of each iterator variable known everywhere.
 * 7.  initialized state of iterators correct for Iter* instructions.
 * 8.  Asserts not separated from following instruction by control flow
 * 9.  Member instruction sequences are consistent and continuous
 * -- All region and branch offsets must refer to valid instruction starts.
 * -- every string table index in-bounds
 * -- every array table index in-bounds
 * -- Local variable ids must be < Func.numLocals
 * -- iter variable ids must be < Func.numIterators
 * -- init-state of every iterator must be known everywhere
 *
 * Not Checked:
 * 1.  empty stack at try-region ends (but starts are checked).  And what
 *     does this mean? -- linear-end or flow-end?
 * 2.  eval stack must be empty in blocks that come before all preds.
 * -- FuncVar entries must refer to valid local ids; no local can have
 *    2+ names.
 * -- FuncStaticVar not checked
 * -- FuncUserAttribute table not checked
 * -- control-flow from DV entry points isn't checked -- we dont require
 *    that entry K fall through to K+1, or whatever.  We either should
 *    check or make the spec say what uninitialized optional params
 *    are set to (Uninit null like uninitialized locals?).
 * -- Function attributes (static, abstract, etc) must all make sense,
 *    certian attributes are mutually exclusive, others aren't, some
 *    imply bytecode restrictions.  (access This from static? etc).
