        many callers aren't even aware that there may be multiple positions,
        and will happily do something reasonable when given an arbitrary one.

          It stores 'Deleted' for symbols which have been deleted since the
          saved-state; once a symbol is in the delta, it never leaves.
          (2) It's used as a cache of naming-table-sqlite lookups, to speed
          them up on subsequent queries, since sqlite is slow.

          names, it always stores both. For cached names, it might store one or both.
