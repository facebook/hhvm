/*
 * Addresses of various unique, long-lived JIT helper routines.

struct UniqueStubs {
  /*
   * Unique stubs, ABIs, and stack alignment.
   *
   * A lot of complex control flow occurs amongst the various unique stubs, as
   * well as between the unique stubs and the TC.  This complexity is
   * exacerbated by the profusion of different ABIs used when entering and
   * exiting the stubs.
   *
   * The goal of the documentation in this file is to enumerate all the ways
   * each stub is reached, as well as to clarify the ABI boundaries they
   * implement to, if any.
   *
   * Among the most important ABI invariants in jitted code is this:
   *
   *    - In the body of a PHP function, after the initial instructions of the
   *      func prologue, the native stack pointer is always 16-byte aligned.
   *
   * This holds even when the register allocator inserts stack spills; we
   * always offset the native stack pointer in increments of 16.
   *
   * Many target architectures have 16-byte stack alignment restrictions.  On
   * x64, for example, the stack must be 16-byte aligned before calls, to allow
   * the compiler to safely use aligned movs, e.g., for saving callee-saved XMM
   * registers.  On AArch64, attempting to address the stack pointer when it is
   * not 16-byte aligned results in a fault.
   *
   * Our alignment invariant should be sufficient for architectures with
   * 16-byte (or looser) alignment constraints.  We don't currently support any
   * higher- order alignment restrictions.
   *
   * Our other ABI concern is calling convention.  HHVM supports three distinct
   * calling conventions:
   *    - native: C++ helper calls on the targeted architecture
   *    - PHP:    calls between PHP functions, as well as to those unique stubs
   *              which play the same role as various parts of PHP functions
   *    - stub:   calls to unique stubs that implement helper routines
   *
   * Maintaining native stack alignment, and appropriately stashing the return
   * address, is shared between the call, return, and callee prologue
   * instructions for each convention:
   *
   *            +---------------------+---------+-----------+
   *            | main call instrs    | return  | prologue  |
   *  +---------+---------------------+---------+-----------+
   *  | native  | call{,r,m,s}        | ret     | N/A       |
   *  +---------+---------------------+---------+-----------+
   *  | PHP     | phpcall, callarray  | phpret  | phplogue  |
   *  +---------+---------------------+---------+----------+
   *  | stub    | callstub            | stubret | stublogue |
   *  +---------+---------------------+---------+-----------+
   *
   * Further documentation on these calling conventions can be found in
   * vasm-instr.h, alongside the corresponding instructions.
   *
   * Each stub is documented below with a (hopefully) exhaustive list of ways
   * it is reached, as well as the context under which it is reached:
   *    - func guard:     pre-phplogue{}; an intermediate state where
   *                      addressing the stack and making native calls are
   *                      forbidden
   *    - func prologue:  implements a phplogue{}
   *    - func body:      dominated by a phplogue{}; already ABI-conforming
   *    - stub:           implements a stublogue{}
