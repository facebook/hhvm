*** Testing basic functionality of count() function ***
-- Testing NULL --
COUNT_NORMAL: should be 0, is 0
COUNT_RECURSIVE: should be 0, is 0
-- Testing arrays --
COUNT_NORMAL: should be 2, is 2
COUNT_RECURSIVE: should be 8, is 8
-- Testing hashes --
COUNT_NORMAL: should be 3, is 3
COUNT_RECURSIVE: should be 6, is 6
-- Testing strings --
COUNT_NORMAL: should be 1, is 1
COUNT_RECURSIVE: should be 1, is 1
-- Testing various types with no second argument --
COUNT_NORMAL: should be 1, is 1
COUNT_NORMAL: should be 2, is 2
-- Testing really cool arrays --
COUNT_NORMAL: should be 3, is 3
COUNT_RECURSIVE: should be 13, is 13

-- Testing error conditions --
Warning: count() expects at least 1 parameter, 0 given in %s/count_recursive.php on line 101

Warning: count() expects at most 2 parameters, 3 given in %s/count_recursive.php on line 102
