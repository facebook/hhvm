(** It can be hard to be precise about what each filtering function does. This
function there is explained in the role it plays. We must ask watchman to give
files that satisfy FilesToIgnore.watchman_server_expression_terms, and once watchman
has given us its raw updates, then we must put them through this function.
If this function says there are any changes, then hh_server will necessarily take some
action in its recheck loop -- maybe do a recheck, or maybe restart because
.hhconfig has changed or similar.

This function takes as input a set of strings representing fully-qualified pathnames
that came out of watchman. They might be symlinks, e.g. if we watch root ~/dir,
and watchman tells us that ~/dir/a.php has changed, it might be that a.php
is really a symlink to something outside the root. This function accordingly
takes in the fully-qualified pathnames from watchman, resolves symlinks,
excludes the ones where the resolved paths are outside root, and runs the same
file_filter as above. *)
