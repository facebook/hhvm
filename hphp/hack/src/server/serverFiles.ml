(** Normally, the ServerFiles.* functions use GlobalConfig.tmp_dir
which is initialized at startup to be either HH_TMPDIR if defined
or /tmp/hh_server otherwise.

But some tests like to use these ServerFiles.* functions with a
different tmpdir chosen at runtime. These tests can call
ServerFiles.set_tmp_FOR_TESTING_ONLY, and all subsequent ServerFiles.*
will refer to that new tmp directory.
CARE! This is only to be used in limited circumstances. All the
rest of the codebase will continue to use HH_TMPDIR-or-/tmp/hh_server.
This only affects the ServerFiles.* functions; nothing else.
You have been warned. *)
