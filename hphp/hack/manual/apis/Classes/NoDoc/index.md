title: NoDoc

:::info[Note]
This is a point-in-time snapshot of the API documentation from January 2026.
Going forward, we will not be maintaining a public copy of these references,
and recommend users to refer to the built-in signature helpers available in
the Hack LSP instead for complete and up-to-date information.
:::

This attribute is used by documentation generation for docs




hhvm.com to hide
annotated functions from having documentation generated for them. This is
generally because said functions are implementation details of some kind.




## Interface Synopsis




``` Hack
final class NoDoc implements HH\FunctionAttribute {...}
```
