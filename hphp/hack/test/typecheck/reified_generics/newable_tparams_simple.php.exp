The type parameter `Tc1` has the `<<__Newable>>` attribute. Newable type parameters must be constrained with `as`, and exactly one of those constraints must be a valid newable class. The class must either be final, or it must have the `<<__ConsistentConstruct>>` attribute or extend a class that has it. The constraints Y, YY are valid newable classes (Typing[4308])

The class must either be final, or it must have the `<<__ConsistentConstruct>>` attribute or extend a class that has it. No constraints are valid newable classes (Typing[4308])
