<h2>Known Limitations</h2>

1. If using the PHP setlocale function, because it is implemented in terms of
setlocale(3), it is process-wide and will affect all requests as well as, for
example, internal logging. One way to mitigate the effect is to call
setlocale(LC_ALL, "C"); at the end of a request to restore the default locale
but this does not change the fact that PHP setlocale() is process-wide.
