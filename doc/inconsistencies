<h2>Inconsistenties</h2>

These are the known inconsistencies between current HipHop and PHP.

1. Operators

(1) instanceof

In PHP, [constant] instanceof [class name] will cause a fatal.
In HipHop, there is no special case for constants and the expression's value is
false.

2. Classes and objects

(1) Exceptions thrown from destructors

In HipHop, exceptions and fatals thrown from destructors will be swallowed
while logging an error. Effectively, there is a try/catch enclosing the body
of the __destruct method. These exceptions are catchable in PHP outside of the
__destruct method.

(2) unset

In PHP, a data member that is unset will not appear at all in vardump or
serialize.
In HipHop, it will still appear, as null.

3. Eval Issues

(1) eval

Is only supported in limited circumstances.
Example unsupported case: phpt...bug21960

(2) create_function

is only supported with literal arguments
Example unsupported case: phpt...bug22690

(3) preg_replace /e

is only supported in limited cases.
Example unsupported case: phpt...bug24403

4. Dynamic declared globals

are not supported, e.g. (phpt...bug24396)

  global $$k;
  $$k = $v;

Also, in PHP, $GLOBALS can be used as a regular variable, for example,

  $GLOBALS = 0;
  $x = $GLOBALS - 5;

In HipHop, this is not allowed.

5. Dynamic declared constants

are not supported, e.g.

  define($name, $value);

6. Misc

(1) get_declared_classes

Can return classes in different order from PHP's.

(2) uninitialized variables

If an uninitialized variable is being used before it's assigned with a value,
and this variable is inferred as integers, it will be 0, instead of null.

(3) calling a function with wrong number of parameters

Currently it's a fatal, and we should change it to warnings as what PHP does.
This only applies to functions that don't have variable arguments, meaning
func_get_arg() or func_get_args() is not called inside the function.
