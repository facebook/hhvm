  // Then we actually try to emit the code, knowing that the cloned $bar is
  // TObj. The first call of baz() would then use a dynamic dispatch, producing
  // a TInitNull. Since the region contains also the second call, we would try
  // to emit it without knowing $this, falling back to the interpreter, which
  // terminates the translation. But the region contains also the third call,
  // so we would emit a bunch of unreachable code full of TBottoms, crashing
  // on random assertions.
