// SmartAllocator (or, to be more specific, ObjectAllocator) is templatized by
// the size of the chunks it allocates. This works fine when we're only
// allocating objects of fixed sizes, known at compile time. However, the VM
// class "Instance" is of variable size (having room for a property vector at
// the end), and the range of sizes it will take on is unknowable at compile
// time.
//
// To work around this, we instantiate the ObjectAllocator template with a size
// from every possible size class. This way, any size class that Instance might
// end up falling into will have an ObjectAllocator.
