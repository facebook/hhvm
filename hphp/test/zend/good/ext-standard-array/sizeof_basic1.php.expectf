*** Testing sizeof() : basic functionality ***
-- Testing sizeof() for integer type in default, COUNT_NORMAL and COUNT_RECURSIVE modes --
default mode: int(1)

COUNT_NORMAL mode: int(1)

COUNT_RECURSIVE mode: int(1)

-- Testing sizeof() for float  type in default, COUNT_NORMAL and COUNT_RECURSIVE modes --
default mode: int(1)

COUNT_NORMAL mode: int(1)

COUNT_RECURSIVE mode: int(1)
