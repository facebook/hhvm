(** [Shallow_classes_heap] provides a cache of shallow class declarations when
    the local config option [shallow_class_decl] is enabled. When it is not
    enabled, this module provides only [class_naming_and_decl], which converts
    an AST to a shallow declaration, and other functions raise an exception. *)
