 * read by sched_ext and used to prioritize threads that have a hint value.
 * Lower hint values will be prioritized over higher ones. Threads without a
 * hint (default) are treated with a priority of 1024. This allows the scheduler
 * to prioritize threads that are processing latency sensitive work
 * (e.g. pre-psp) over other threads.

 * Thread hints are set via config, Server.ScxThreadHintIdle, etc.
