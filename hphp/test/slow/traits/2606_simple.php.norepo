\\ Repo mode does not handle getTraitAliases correctly
\\ instead of printing out Foo::Bar(), it prints (null)::Bar()
\\ D1314228 fixed the problem for the non-repo case.
\\ Look at emitter.cpp::emitClassTraitAliasRule()
\\ for a possible starting point to fix
\\
\\ Doesn't work, but was thinking about something like:
\\  if (traitName->empty()) {
\\    ClassScopePtr traitCls = stmt->getClassScope();
\\    traitName = makeStaticString(traitCls->getOriginalName());
\\  }
