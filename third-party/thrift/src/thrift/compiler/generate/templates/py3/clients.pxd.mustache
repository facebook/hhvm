Cython wrappers of the C++ client classes that were generated by thrift.
By convention, service classes have a c in front of them to differentiate them
from the Python classes, which have no differentiation. That allows the Python
calling code to call into the code without any awkward prefixes or suffixes.

This is a top-level file that gets imported by the CythonClients.pyx file. That
file exposes Python wrappers of the services client to the end user.
