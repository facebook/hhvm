(** Note: the tracking in this module is best effort only;
 * it's not guaranteed to always reflect accurate merge base transitions:
 * - in some init types, initial merge base is not known so we will only notice
 *   the second transition
 * - to avoid blocking rest of the system, mergebase queries time out after 30
 *   seconds and are not retried in case of errors
 * - we only record "new" mergebases as we see them, not detecting transitions
 *   between already visited revisions

(** A list of all unpaired "hg.update.enter", "hg.update.leave", "hg.transaction.enter",
"hg.transaction.leave" events that we have encountered, sorted by time, most recent first.
Because they are unpaired, the list will never contain both X.enter and X.leave for a given source.
Meaning, from the perspective of consulting the list to see whether we are in a state,
or amending the list because we just received a state-transition event, is the same
1. We are "in a state" if there exist any enter events
2. A new leave will be paired to the most recent enter, if present.
3. A new enter will be paired to the most recent leave only if it is recent; otherwise we ditch the leave, and log.
4. Observe the consequence, that existence of "enter" events can only be discharged either by
a subsequent leave, or an outstanding one from the recent past.
