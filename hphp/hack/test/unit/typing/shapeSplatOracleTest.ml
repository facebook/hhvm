(* Differential DENOTATIONAL oracle for shape-splat subtyping.
 *
 * The subtyping decision under test is [Typing_subtype.is_sub_type], which routes
 * shape-splat queries through the corner procedure (Shape_splat.Corner). We compare
 * it against a ground-truth oracle that is INDEPENDENT of the subtyping code:
 *
 *   - A finite, RECURSIVE (depth-bounded) value model: a "record" maps each label
 *     of a fixed universe to absent / a scalar (int or bool) / a nested shape value
 *     (one level deep). The value space is finite.
 *   - [denot row] = the set of records a simple row admits.
 *   - Ground subrow truth = [denot sub] is a subset of [denot super].
 *   - The rightmost-wins splat merge is REIMPLEMENTED here (not via
 *     Typing_shape_normalize), so the whole pipeline (merge + subtype) is tested.
 *   - For a rigid generic T with bound [lower, upper], the semantic truth is the
 *     forall-instantiation check: for every concrete row R with lower <: R <: upper
 *     (denotationally), [denot (merge sub[T:=R])] subset [denot (merge super[T:=R])].
 *
 * A mismatch (decision <> oracle) is either an oracle bug or a REAL subtyping bug. *)

(* == Two parameters, one bounded by the other ============================= *)

   cannot express, so nothing above reaches the code that reads a bound through
   another parameter -- which is where reading a lower bound via SUPERtypes hid.

   Only the SOUNDNESS direction is asserted here (never accept what the oracle
   rejects), not equality. The corner procedure assigns [T1] and [T2] corners
   independently and so over-rejects when a row over one is checked against a
   row over the other, even though [T2 <: T1] makes the relation hold -- see
   two_param_bound.php. Asserting equality would block on that known
   incompleteness and lose the unsoundness check this property exists for.

(* == Inference oracle: spread type-variables via ∃-instantiation =========== *)

(* At a call site a splat type-parameter becomes a fresh inference variable. The
   local decision [is_sub_type] with a fresh, unconstrained spread var in the sub-
   or super-row is sound+complete iff it accepts exactly when SOME row R can
   instantiate the var to make the ground subrow hold: the ∃-semantics of
   inference, dual to the ∀-semantics of a rigid parameter. This is the property
   the [poly_error_missing_field] soundness bug violated — an unsatisfiable
   required field on the super side was silently accepted. Ranging the oracle over
   [all_rows] models the declared bound [T as shape(...)] (an open shape admits
   every record, so R is unconstrained). *)

(* An inference var standing in for a splat type-parameter carries the declared
   [T as shape(...)] upper bound (an open shape, unknown = mixed). Without it the
   var's combined upper bound would be [mixed] — not a shape — and the corner
   procedure would (correctly) reject spreading it. *)

(* The ∃-range must include UNINHABITED witnesses: a spread var can be instantiated
   with a row whose field is required-with-type-nothing [(false, [])], which under
   rightmost-wins merge collapses the whole shape to bottom — and bottom is a subtype
   of anything. The corner procedure enumerates this "bottom corner", so without such
   rows the oracle would spuriously report [oracle=false] against a correct
   [decision=true] (e.g. shape('a'=>bool, ...#1) <: shape() closed, satisfied by
   #1 := shape('a'=>nothing)). These rows are only meaningful as instantiations, so
