description: >
  Debug code uses a static buffer as a formatting temporary to avoid side
  effects in debug prints.  The static buffer is large by default, which
  may be an issue in constrained environments.  You can set the buffer size
  manually with this option.  Example: -DDUK_OPT_DEBUG_BUFSIZE=2048.
