Awaitable<int>
---
An `async` block is syntactic sugar for an `async` lambda that is immediately called.

```
$f = async { return 1; };
// Equivalent to:
$f = (async () ==> { return 1; })();
```

This is useful when building more complex async expressions.

```
concurrent {
  $group_name = await async {
    return $group is null ? '' : await $group->genName();
  };
  await async {
    try {
      await gen_log_request();
    } catch (LogRequestFailed $_) {}
  }
}
```
