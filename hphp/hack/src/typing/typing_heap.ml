open Typing_defs

(* The following classes are used to make sure we make no typing
 * mistake when interacting with the database. The database knows
 * how to associate a string to a string. We need to deserialize
 * the string and make sure the type is correct. By using these
 * modules, the places where there could be a typing mistake are
 * very well isolated.
