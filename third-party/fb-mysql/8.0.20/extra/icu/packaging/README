This directory contains information, input files and scripts for
packaging ICU using specific packaging tools. We assume that the
packager is familiar with the tools and procedures needed to build a
package for a given packaging method (for example, how to use
dpkg-buildpackage(1) on Debian GNU/Linux, or rpm(8) on distributions that
use RPM packages).

Please read the file PACKAGES if you are interested in packaging ICU
yourself. It describes what the different packages should be, and what
their contents are.
