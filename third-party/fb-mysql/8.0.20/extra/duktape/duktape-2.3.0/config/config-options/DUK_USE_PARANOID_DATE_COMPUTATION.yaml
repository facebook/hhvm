  There was a curious bug where test-bi-date-canceling.js would fail e.g.
  on 64-bit Ubuntu, gcc-4.8.1, -m32, and no -std=c99.  Some date computations
  using doubles would be optimized which then broke some corner case tests.
  The problem goes away by adding 'volatile' to the datetime computations.
  Not sure what the actual triggering conditions are, but using this on
  non-C99 systems solves the known issues and has relatively little cost
  on other platforms.

  Recommended for non-C99 platforms.
