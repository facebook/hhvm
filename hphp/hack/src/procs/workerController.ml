(*****************************************************************************
 * Module building workers
 *
 * A worker is a subprocess executing an arbitrary function
 *
 * You should first create a fixed amount of workers and then use those
 * because the amount of workers is limited and to make the load-balancing
 * of tasks better (cf multiWorker.ml)
 *
 * On Unix, we spawn workers when initializing Hack. Then, each
 * worker forks a clone process for each incoming request.
 * The forked clone will exit after processing a single request.
 *
 * On Windows, we do not pre-spawn when initializing Hack, we just
 * allocate all the required information into a record. Then, we
 * spawn a worker process for each incoming request.
 * It will also exit after one request.
 *
 * A worker never handles more than one request at a time.
