Some tests are known to fail with HHBBC:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Slow:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This test is sensitive to how much data the JIT allocates using the
smart allocator, which appears to be perturbed by this stuff right
now.

  hphp/test/slow/ext_datetime/strtotime_leak.php (jit only)

This test is failing (only with HardConstProp) because this propagates
a class constant that hphpc doesn't propagate and autoload order
changes.  This one might be ok (this optimization is allowed to break
autoload order in hphpc too).

  hphp/test/slow/volatile/1221.php
