  Enable fast path for Array.prototype operations like push(), pop(), etc.
  The fast path handles dense Array instances which are more common than
  sparse arrays or non-array objects (which Array.prototype operations must
  also support).  The fast path assumes that Array.prototype doesn't contain
  inherited index properties; such properties are very rarely used in
  practical code.  If compliance is critical, disable the fast path.
