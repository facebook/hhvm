  (* lockfile already exists and so terminate with error code 0 immediately   *)
  (* without sending the "ready" message. And the second start_server call    *)
  (* will fail its assert that a "ready" message should come.                 *)
  (*                                                                          *)
  (* Second scenario: one process does 'hh start', and creates the lockfile,  *)
  (* and after a short delay will start listening on its socket. Another      *)
  (* process does 'hh start', sees the lockfile is present, tries to connect, *)
  (* but we're still in above short delay and so it gets ECONNREFUSED         *)
  (* immediately, which (given the presence of a lockfile) is returned as     *)
  (* Monitor_not_ready. The should_start routine deems this an unresponsive   *)
  (* server and so kills it and launches a new server again. The first        *)
  (* process might or might not report failure, depending on how far it got   *)
  (* with its 'hh start' -- i.e. whether or not it yet observed the "ready".  *)
  (*                                                                          *)
  (* Third and most typical scenario: an LSP client like Nuclide is running,  *)
  (* and the user does 'hh restart' which kills the server and then calls     *)
  (* start_server. As soon as LSP sees the server killed, it too immediately  *)
  (* calls ClientStart.main. Maybe it will see the lockfile absent, and so    *)
  (* proceed according to the first race scenario above. Maybe it will see    *)
  (* the lockfile present and proceed according to the second race scenario   *)
  (* above. In both cases the LSP client will see problem reports.            *)

  (* The root problem is that should_start assumes an invariant that "if      *)
     (* hh_server monitor is busy then it has failed and should be shut down." *)
  (* This invariant isn't true. Note that the reason we call should_start,    *)
  (* rather than just using the default ClientConnect.autorestart which calls *)
  (* into ClientStart.start_server, is because we do like its ability to kill *)
  (* an unresponsive server. So the should_start function should simply give  *)
  (* a grace period in case of a temporarily busy server.                     *)

  (* when its env.autorestart is true. During the short delay window it might *)
  (* immediately get Server_missing similar to the first scenario, and so     *)
  (* ClientStart.start_server, which will fail in the same way. Or it might   *)
