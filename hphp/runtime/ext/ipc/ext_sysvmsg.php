 * @param bool $blocking - If the message is too large to fit in the queue,

 *   and frees enough space for your message to be sent. This is called
 *   blocking; you can prevent blocking by setting the optional blocking

 *   0, the first message on the queue with the lowest type less than or equal

 *   the criteria, your script will wait until a suitable message arrives on the
 *   queue. You can prevent the script from blocking by specifying
 *   MSG_IPC_NOWAIT in the flags parameter.
 * @param mixed $msgtype - The type of the message that was received will be
 *   stored in this parameter.
 * @param int $maxsize - The maximum size of message to be accepted is
 *   specified by the maxsize; if the message in the queue is larger than this
 *   size the function will fail (unless you set flags as described below).
 * @param mixed $message - The received message will be stored in message,

 * @param bool $unserialize - If set to TRUE, the message is treated as though
 *   it was serialized using the same mechanism as the session module. The
 *   message will be unserialized and then returned to your script. This allows
 *   you to easily receive arrays or complex object structures from other PHP
 *   scripts.  If unserialize is FALSE, the message will be returned as a
 *   binary-safe string.
 * @param int $flags - The optional flags allows you to pass flags to the
 *   low-level msgrcv system call. It defaults to 0, but you may specify one or
 *   more of the following values (by adding or ORing them together). Flag
 *   values for msg_receive MSG_IPC_NOWAIT If there are no messages of the
 *   desiredmsgtype, return immediately and do not wait. The function will fail
 *   and return an integer value corresponding to MSG_ENOMSG. MSG_EXCEPT Using
 *   this flag in combination with a desiredmsgtype greater than 0 will cause
 *   the function to receive the first message that is not equal to
 *   desiredmsgtype. MSG_NOERROR If the message is longer than maxsize, setting
 *   this flag will truncate the message to maxsize and will not signal an
 *   error.
 * @param mixed $errorcode - If the function fails, the optional errorcode
 *   will be set to the value of the system errno variable.
 *
 * @return bool - Returns TRUE on success or FALSE on failure.  Upon
 *   successful completion the message queue data structure is updated as
 *   follows: msg_lrpid is set to the process-ID of the calling process,
 *   msg_qnum is decremented by 1 and msg_rtime is set to the current time.
