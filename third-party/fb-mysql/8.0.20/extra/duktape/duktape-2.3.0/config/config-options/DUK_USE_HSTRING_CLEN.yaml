description: >
  When DUK_USE_STRLEN16 enabled, indicates whether the character length
  (clen16) field should be actually present (default) or computed on-the-fly.

  When clen is computed on-the-fly the duk_hstring structure will be 4 bytes
  smaller (from 10 bytes + 2 bytes padding to 8 bytes) which may be useful for
  very low memory targets.
