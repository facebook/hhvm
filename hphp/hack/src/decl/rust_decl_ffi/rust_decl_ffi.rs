/// The convenience, the interop bridge between single-threaded and multi-threaded, boils down to this function which is called
/// from the single-threaded ocaml side:
///   val enqueue_next_and_get_earlier_results : handle -> Relative_path.t list -> Relative_path.t * parsed_file) option
/// What is does is enqueue a list of workitems (relative-paths which we want direct-decl-parsed) onto the rust multithreaded side,
/// and then blocks synchronously until the next available result (a parsed_file) comes from rust. The next available result might
/// be for one of the workitems we placed just now. But it might also come from one of the earlier calls we made to this same function!
///
/// The implementation behind this is to use rayon:
/// For each relative-path, we do rayon::spawn to put the path (or rather, a lambda to process that path) into rayon's global workitem
/// queue. Rayon actually stores that queue amongst threads rather than having one single storage; it uses work stealing amongst threads.
/// Prior to spawn, we increment an integer outstanding. This integer lives on the main thread.
/// When the spawned lambda has finished direct-decl-parsing, it sends the results over a crossbeam channel.
/// The main thread will wait for the next available result over the crossbeam channel, and decrement the outstanding integer.
/// This way, if ever the integer is >0, we are guaranteed that a blocking wait on the channel will eventually be fulfilled.
///
/// ## Polymorphic tag, for metadata
/// I actually made the function take a polymorphic tag 'a for metadata which accompanies the workitem, and is sent back to ocaml
/// alongside that workitem's result, without ever having been read by the rust side.
///   val enqueue_next_and_get_earlier_results : handle -> (Relative_path.t * 'a) list -> (Relative_path.t * 'a * parsed_file) option
/// It's solely there as a handy place to store metadata. For instance, Decl_provider_prefetch.ml uses it because (1) knows
/// it wants to prefetch the ancestors for class C, (2) it enqueues a work item to direct-decl-parse c.php, (3) when it gets the
