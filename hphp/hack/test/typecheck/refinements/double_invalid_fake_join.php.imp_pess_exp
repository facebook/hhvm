Invalid return type (Typing[4110])
  File "double_invalid_fake_join.php", line 10, characters 24-26:
  Expected `~int` because the type of this return is implicitly a like-type
  File "double_invalid_fake_join.php", line 4, characters 10-13:
  But got `?int`
  File "double_invalid_fake_join.php", line 15, characters 5-14:

This is a limitation of the type-checker; use a local if that's the problem.
