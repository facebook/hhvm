description: >
  Use a packed 8-byte representation for duk_tval.  The packed representation
  represents non-number values as special IEEE double NaN values, and is only
  possible for platforms with 32-bit pointers.  When the packed representation
  is not available, Duktape uses a 12-16 byte struct/union which is more
  portable.
