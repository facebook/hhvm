*** Testing sizeof() : basic functionality ***
-- Testing sizeof() with integer array in default, COUNT_NORMAL, COUNT_RECURSIVE modes --
default mode: int(4)

COUNT_NORMAL mode: int(4)

COUNT_RECURSIVE mode: int(4)

-- Testing sizeof() with string array in default, COUNT_NORMAL, COUNT_RECURSIVE modes --
default mode: int(3)

COUNT_NORMAL mode: int(3)

COUNT_RECURSIVE mode: int(3)

-- Testing sizeof() with indexed array in default, COUNT_NORMAL, COUNT_RECURSIVE modes --
default mode: int(3)

COUNT_NORMAL mode: int(3)

COUNT_RECURSIVE mode: int(3)

-- Testing sizeof() with mixed array in default, COUNT_NORMAL, COUNT_RECURSIVE modes --
default mode: int(5)

COUNT_NORMAL mode: int(5)

COUNT_RECURSIVE mode: int(5)
Done
