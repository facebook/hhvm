/*
 * "Type scanners" is machinery to automatically generate functions to walk
 * instances of arbitrary types. These functions report pointers to other
 * allocated types. These will be used by the marking phase of the garbage
 * collector. This avoids having to write manual scan functions for the large
 * number of types which can be allocated in the request heap.
 *
 * Basic use: Call type_scan::init() as early as possible. Tag any allocation
 * out of the request heap by calling getIndexForMalloc<T>() (where T is the
 * type being allocated) and storing the returned type-index somewhere it can be
 * retrieved later. Then when trying to scan that allocation, retrieve the
 * type-index, and call the Scanner::scanByIndex() passing in the type-index. If
 * one wishes to scan a type which isn't request heap allocated (for example, a
 * root), use Scanner::scan<T>() instead.
 *
 * That's the basic use case. One can customize this greatly by using custom
 * actions at the allocation site (see below), and adding custom annotations to
 * the types being scanned. Most users don't need to concern themselves with any
 * of this, as most of the complexity is hidden behind the allocator interface
 * and standard container replacements.
 *
 * Note that there are certain constructs that can appear in types which the
 * scanner generator cannot handle automatically. They include (but may not be
 * exhaustive):
 *
 * - Pointers to void
 * - Unions (if the different members do not have the same runtime layout)
 * - Virtual inheritance
 * - Arrays of indeterminate size
 *
 * If any of these occur, there will be an error while generating the functions,
 * and annotations will be required to resolve (see below).
