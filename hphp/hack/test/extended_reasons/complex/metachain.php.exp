via the generic T

I found the supertype for [Upper / Main] when I checked the subtype constraint in [Upper / Upper].

  Upper / Upper                                                  

  [Upper / Upper] Step 1 of 1                      

I started by checking this subtype relationship.

The subtype comes from this hint
