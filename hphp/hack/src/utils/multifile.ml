(* We have some hacky "syntax extensions" to have one file contain multiple

 * testing lint rules, some of which activate only on certain paths. It's also
 * useful for testing abstract types, since the abstraction is enforced at the
 * file boundary.
 * Takes the path to a single file, returns a map of filenames to file contents.
