:::info[Note]
This is a point-in-time snapshot of the API documentation from January 2026.
Going forward, we will not be maintaining a public copy of these references,
and recommend users to refer to the built-in signature helpers available in
the Hack LSP instead for complete and up-to-date information.
:::

Instantiate a ` WrappedResult `




``` Hack
public function __construct(
  T $result,
);
```




Normally, you will not instantiate a ` WrappedResult ` directly, but rather
have one returned back to you on a call to `` wrap() `` if the operation
succeeded.




## Parameters




+ ` T $result ` - The result of the [` Awaitable `](/apis/Classes/HH/Awaitable/) operation.
