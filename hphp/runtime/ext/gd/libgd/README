This directory contains the GD library available from 
http://www.boutell.com/gd/

The inclusion of this library with PHP is in response to the 
popularity of the GD extension and the GD library itself.  We felt
it would be worthwhile to make sure everyone had access to the
features of GD and by bundling GD with PHP we have a known target to
work against.

In addition to the above, a number of motivated PHP hackers have
expressed an interest in extending the functionality of the PHP-GD
combination.  By putting a version of GD into PHP CVS we have provided
a sandbox for them to throw sand at each other in.  Any and all
improvements we make to the GD library will be contributed back to the
original maintainers of this library at boutell.com.

The following statement is from the original GD package:
