   - Remove all members (except for the toString method, which results in the
     implicit inclusion of the Stringish interface),
   - Replace all positions with Pos.none

   We consider any difference between normalized classes to be a "Major change".
   This means only that we have not implemented some means of computing a fanout
   for that change which is smaller than what would be added by
   Shallow_class_fanout.add_maximum_fanout (e.g., since we DO have fine-grained
   dependency tracking for uses of members, and can handle them in a more
   intelligent way, we remove them during major-change-detection).

   There are certainly opportunities for us to be cleverer about some kinds of
   changes, but any kind of cleverness in reducing fanout must be implemented
   with great care. *)
