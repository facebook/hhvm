/* assert() will check the given assertion and take appropriate action if its
 * result is FALSE.  If the assertion is given as a string it will be
 * evaluated as PHP code by assert(). The advantages of a string assertion are
 * less overhead when assertion checking is off and messages containing the
 * assertion expression when an assertion fails. This means that if you pass a
 * boolean condition as assertion this condition will not show up as parameter
 * to the assertion function which you may have defined with the
 * assert_options() function, the condition is converted to a string before
 * calling that handler function, and the boolean FALSE is converted as the
 * empty string.  Assertions should be used as a debugging feature only. You
 * may use them for sanity-checks that test for conditions that should always
 * be TRUE and that indicate some programming errors if not or to check for
 * the presence of certain features like extension functions or certain system
 * limits and features.  Assertions should not be used for normal runtime
 * operations like input parameter checks. As a rule of thumb your code should
 * always be able to work correctly if assertion checking is not activated.
 * The behavior of assert() may be configured by assert_options() or by
 * .ini-settings described in that functions manual page.  The
 * assert_options() function and/or ASSERT_CALLBACK configuration directive
 * allow a callback function to be set to handle failed assertions.  assert()
 * callbacks are particularly useful for building automated test suites
 * because they allow you to easily capture the code passed to the assertion,
 * along with information on where the assertion was made. While this
 * information can be captured via other methods, using assertions makes it
 * much faster and easier!  The callback function should accept three
 * arguments. The first argument will contain the file the assertion failed
 * in. The second argument will contain the line the assertion failed on and
 * the third argument will contain the expression that failed (if any -
 * literal values such as 1 or "two" will not be passed via this argument)
