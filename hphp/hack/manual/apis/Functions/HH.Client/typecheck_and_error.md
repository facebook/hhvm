:::info[Note]
This is a point-in-time snapshot of the API documentation from January 2026.
Going forward, we will not be maintaining a public copy of these references,
and recommend users to refer to the built-in signature helpers available in
the Hack LSP instead for complete and up-to-date information.
:::

This is deliberately an unconfigurable convenience wrapper




``` Hack
namespace HH\Client;

function typecheck_and_error(): void;
```




If you want
full configurability, call typecheck() and use the TypecheckResult
yourself.




## Returns




+ ` void `
