(** [keep_trying_to_open] tries to open the errors.bin file.
  There is a whole load of ceremony to do with what happens when you want to open errors.bin,
  e.g. start the server if necessary, check for version mismatch, report failures to the user.
  Concrete examples:
  * There is no server running. "hh check" must start up a server, before it can stream errors from it.
  * There is no server running, but our attempt to start the server failed, either
    synchronously (e.g. we had `--autostart-server false`)
    or asynchronously (e.g. saved-state failed to load).
    "hh check" must detect that no streaming errors are forthcoming.
  * There is a server running, and it has already written errors.bin, but it is the wrong binary version.
    "hh check" must cause it to shut down, and a new server start up, before it can stream errors.
  * There is an errors.bin from an existing server, and its typecheck started 20s ago, but moments
    before "hh check" a file was changed on disk. "hh check" must detect this,
    learn that it cannot use the existing errors.bin, and instead use the
    new errors.bin that will be forthcoming.
    We care about that case very much as we anticipate a common use case is to
    save a file and immediately type hh afterwards. We wouldn't want that `hh`
    call to return the old errors.

  How this function fulfills those cases:
  * It of course has to check whether files on disk have changed since this errors.bin was started.
    It does this with a synchronous file watcher query,
    and displays "hh_server is busy [file watcher sync]".
  * If there is a fault like "errors.bin was started too long ago and files have changed
    in the meantime" which can be rectified by waiting and trying again on the assumption
    that a server is running and will pick up the changes, then this will wait and try
    again indefinitely. It will display "hh_server is busy [hh_server sync]".
    The parameter [already_checked_clock] indicates that we have already done a
    (costly) file watcher query for this clock, and will not do another file watcher query until
    we see a new errors.bin which started at a different (newer) clock.
  * If there is a fault like "missing errors.bin" or "binary mismatch" which can
    be rectified by connecting to the monitor+server, this will do so at most once
    with the [connect_then_close] callback parameter, then resume looking for a
    suitable errors.bin again with "hh_server is busy [hh_server sync]".
    If it already tried once with no effect, then it will raise Exit_status.Exit_with.

  Here's a really subtle example involving precise details of the errors.bin clock:
  1. server starts a check at clock0, hence starts errors.bin as of clock0
  2. modify file A
  3. modify file B
  4. user does "hh", hh sees that files have changed since clock0, so repeats [keep_trying_to_open]
  5. server picks up change to file A and restarts errors.bin as of clockA
  6. repeat of [keep_trying_to_open] must NOT use errors.bin since that would miss "B"

  There are two implementations we could imagine for the repeat of [keep_trying_to_open]:
  (A) on subsequent repeats, it could either keep waiting until an errors.bin comes about
  which has a clock that's more recent than the start time of "hh"; or (B) it could keep
  waiting until an errors.bin comes about where there are no changed files between
  errors.bin's start time and "now". Both are correct; the former is more principled,
  would result in more "files changed under your feet", but alas there doesn't exist
  the ability in watchman or Edenfs notifications to compare two clocks so we can't use it.
  Therefore we use (B).
  How do we know that (B) will eventually terminate? Well if the user keeps modifying
  files then it never will! But if the user stops, then hh_server is guaranteed to
  do a final recheck, hence guaranteed to write an errors.bin with no files changed
  after it, and hence [keep_trying_to_open] is guaranteed to eventually terminate.

  The semantics of the [deadline] parameter are that this is how long we'll wait
  until we open an errors.bin file (i.e. until the typecheck has started). We don't
  expose a parameter to control how long the typecheck must last.

  SPINNER! This is surprisingly delicate. If we leave our spinner up and then
  the process exits, the user sees a dead spinner in the line above their bash prompt.
  If we leave our spinner up and then print an error message to stderr, the user
  sees a dead spinner above the error message (and perhaps even another spinner down
  below if we continued work). In summary it's crucial to clear out the spinner at the right time:
  * [connect_then_close] is assumed to clear the spinner in case it writes to stderr
  * This function clears the spinner in case of exceptions
  * But it leaves the spinner at "file watcher sync" in case of success, in the expectation
  that subsequent code will update the spinner. *)
