 * This is a simple data structure that allows querying for the docblock
 * given a line in the source code. Rough description:
 *
 * 1. Find the last comment preceding the line of the definition.
 *    We also make sure this doesn't overlap with the preceding definition.
 *    If the last comment is more than 1 line away, it is ignored.
 *
 * 2. If the last comment is a block-style comment (/* */) just return it.
 *
 * 3. Otherwise (if it is a line style comment //) attempt to merge it with
 *    preceding line comments, if they exist.
 *      NOTE: We also enforce that line comments must be on the definition's
 *            immediately preceding line.

(** Tidies up a delimited comment.

    1. Strip the leading `/*` and trailing `*/`.
    2. Remove leading whitespace equal to the least amount of whitespace
       before any comment lines after the first (since the first line is on
       the same line as the opening `/*`, it will almost always have only a
       single leading space).

       We remove leading whitespace equal to the least amount rather than
       removing all leading whitespace in order to preserve manual indentation
       of text in the doc block.

    3. Remove leading `*` characters to properly handle box-style multiline
       doc blocks. Without this they would be formatted as Markdown lists.

  Known failure cases:
    1. A doc block which is legitimately just a list of items will need at
       least one non-list item which is under-indented compared to the list in
       order to not strip all of the whitespace from the list items. The
       easiest way to do this is to write a little one line summary before the
       list and place it on its own line instead of directly after the `/*`.
