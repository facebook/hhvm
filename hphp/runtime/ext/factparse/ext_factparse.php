/**
 * Read a set of HH/PHP files and quickly extract the main features aka. "Facts"
 * about their contents. Compared to require'ing a source file this is much
 * faster and doesn't cause excessive memory consumption as compiled results are
 * not kept around.
 *
 * The intended use of this data is to gather info about a large number of
 * source files to perform queries about a codebase as a whole. For example this
 * can be used to make an autoloader or perform reflection queries of the form
 * "find all classes in a source tree which match pattern XYZ" etc.
 *
 * The useThreads argument specifies whether to use a number of worker threads
 * equal to the number of system CPU cores for parsing. This feature should only
 * be used as part of warm-up operations and not on a running system which may
 * have a high CPU load with new/in-flight requests.
 *
 * The allowHipHopSyntax argument enables HH syntax in all files parsed. By
 * default only files starting with `<?hh` may have HH syntax.
 *
 * Each pathList item will map to one result entry in the returned array. If
 * there were any errors when parsing a file the result entry for that file will
 * be null, otherwise a result will be of the form:
 *
 *   array(
 *     'md5sum0' => int 64bits of md5sum of path contents + HHVM runtime flags,
 *     'md5sum1' => int next 64bits of path md5sum,
 *     'types' => details of 'types' in the file (traits/classes/interfaces)
 *       array(
 *         array(
 *           'name' => string name of this 'type',
 *           'kindOf' => string =
 *              'class'|'interface'|'enum'|'trait'|'unknown'|'mixed',
 *           'baseTypes' => array(string) of base 'types' for this type,
 *           'flags' => integer with combination of flags from FactParseFlags,
 *           'requireImplements' => array(string) of interfaces users of this
 *             trait must implement (only present when kindOf = trait).
 *           'requireExtends' => array(string) of classes which users of this
 *             trait or interface must extend (only present when kindOf =
 *             trait | interface)
 *         ),
 *         array(
 *           'name' => string,
 *           'baseTypes' => array(string),
 *         ),
 *         ...
 *     ),
 *     'constants' => array(string) constants defined in this file,
 *     'functions' => array(string) functions defined in this file,
 *     'typeAliases' => array(string) type aliases defined in this file,
 *   )
 *
 * pathList items which are not absolute are joined with a non-null "root"
 * argument.
