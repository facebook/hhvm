title: Source Control Aware Queries

*Since 2021.08.30*

[Git support](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/pull/934) has been added 🎊

*Since 4.9.*

*The [capability](/watchman/docs/capabilities.html) name associated with this
enhanced functionality is `scm-since`.*

The capability name for this is `scm-hg`.  The internal architecture allows
supporting other source control systems quite easily; it just needs someone to
implement and test them!

A common pattern for tools that consume watchman is wanting to reason about
the changes in a version controlled repository.  For most repos it is fine
to simply receive information about all changed files as they are updated,
even during a rebase over several days of work by others.

For very large or very busy repositories, where a great many files can change
over a short period of time, it can be desirable to get a minimized set of
information about the changes.

For example, if your tool has the ability to load some pre-built data from
some artifact storage, rather than processing many hundreds of changed
files incrementally you may want to take the merge base of local changes
and use that to locate the pre-built data and process only the delta
between that state and the current state of the repo.

An illustration may help.  Here we see that a user has a stack of two commits
based off the symbolic `main` commit.  In this scenario, `main` is tracking
the tip of the repo to which the local repo is published, and the user is
checked out at the 6b38a5 commit:


~~~
| @  6b38a5  wez
| |  Add cats.cpp
| |
| o  fa2e92  wez
|/   Add cat.jpg
|
o f12345 main
~~~

Now the user synchronizes their repo with the remote, fetching the commits but
not changing their work yet.   This is often combined with the step that follows,
but we are breaking it out here for the purposes of illustration.  This is
equivalent to running `hg pull` or `git fetch`:

~~~
o  fabf87  coworker     main
.  Amazing new feature
.
| @  6b38a5  wez
| |  Add cats.cpp
| |
| o  fa2e92  wez
|/   Add cat.jpg
|
o
~~~

The ellipsis portion of the DAG represents uninteresting commits to `wez`; there
may be hundreds of files changed by those commits, but `wez` only cares about the
work in their local branch of the DAG.

Now `wez` wants to rebase their work on main.  This would be done using
a command like `hg rebase -d main -s fa2e92`:

~~~
| @  bbbbbb  wez
| |  Add cats.cpp
| |
| o  aaaaaa  wez
|/   Add cat.jpg
|
o  fabf87  coworker     main
.  Amazing new feature
.
~~~

The crucial part of this is what happens to the working copy; assuming that we now land
on commit `bbbbbb`, Watchman will observe changes for all of the hundreds of files that
changed across the rebase and pass this information on to the tools that are subscribed
or are querying for this information.

If your tooling is source control aware then you can ask watchman to run since queries
in a mode where it will return you information about the merge base with `main` and
the minimized set of files that changed.

To enable this mode you issue a query using a new *fat clock* as the `since` parameter
for the query:

~~~bash
$ watchman -j <<-EOT
["query", "/path/to/root", {
  "since": {
      "scm": {
        "mergebase-with": "main"
      }
  },
  "expression": ["type", "f"],
  "fields": ["name"]
}]
EOT
~~~

This particular `since` value starts with an unspecified clock value and requests that
watchman run the query in source control aware mode, using the symbolic name `main`
to compute the merge base for the commit graph.

If we look back to the illustrations above and rewind to the first scenario,
the results of this query will look something like this:

~~~
{
   "clock": {
       "clock": "c:123:123",
       "scm": {
            "mergebase": "f12345",
            "mergebase-with": "main"
       }
    },
    "files": ["cat.jpg", "cats.cpp"]
}
~~~

This result informs the client of the merge base with main (which happens to
be main itself) and the list of changes since that merge base.

To get the next incremental change the client feeds that clock value back in to its
next query.  Looking back to the second illustration above, if we were to run this query
after the running `hg pull` (note that this doesn't change the working copy):

~~~bash
$ watchman -j <<-EOT
["query", "/path/to/root", {
  "since": {
       "clock": "c:123:123",
       "scm": {
            "mergebase": "f12345",
            "mergebase-with": "main"
       }
  },
  "expression": ["type", "f"],
  "fields": ["name"]
}]
EOT
~~~

we'd get this result:

~~~json
{
   "clock": {
       "clock": "c:123:124",
       "scm": {
            "mergebase": "f12345",
            "mergebase-with": "main"
       }
    },
    "files": []
}
~~~

Note that the `files` list is empty because we didn't change any files, and
note that one of the numeric portions of the clock string has changed.

Also note that the mergebase revision remains the same because we also didn't
rebase the commit yet.

This is a little white lie: the reality is that some files did change in the
version control system, and with the expression we're using we would see them,
but they are not part of the working copy so we're omitting them for the clarity
of this example.

Now if we rebase and update to the rebased revision (taking us to the last of the
illustrations from above), we'd run this query, feeding in the clock from the last
query to get the correct incremental result:

~~~bash
$ watchman -j <<-EOT
["query", "/path/to/root", {
  "since": {
       "clock": "c:123:124",
       "scm": {
            "mergebase": "f12345",
            "mergebase-with": "main"
       }
  },
  "expression": ["type", "f"],
  "fields": ["name"]
}]
EOT
~~~

we'd get this result:

~~~json
{
   "clock": {
       "clock": "c:123:125",
       "scm": {
            "mergebase": "fabf87",
            "mergebase-with": "main"
       }
    },
    "files": ["cat.jpg", "cats.cpp"]
}
~~~

Note that the mergebase reported in the clock has changed and note that the
list of files reported is just the two from our commit stack despite there
being hundreds of files that were physically updated on the disk.

Your client can now lookup some state based on the `fabf87` revision and
download it, and can then incrementally apply the computation for `cat.jpg` and
`cats.cpp` on top of that state.

If your client doesn't know how to do this, then you shouldn't use this
source control aware query mode!


## Source Control Aware Subscriptions

You can also use the same source control awareness in your subscriptions.  This
is basically the same procedure as making queries above, but there are some
preconditions and things to note:

* Watchman needs the cooperation of the source control system to know when
  it should defer events.
* Source control aware subscriptions implicitly enable `defer_vcs` and
  `defer:["hg.update"]`.  As with the point above, this is to ensure that
  you don't get notified about files changing during the working copy update
  operation; that would defeat the point of using source control awareness.

To initiate a source control aware subscription:

~~~json
["subscribe", "/path/to/root", "mysubscriptionname", {
  "fields": ["name"],
  "since": {
    "scm": {
      "mergebase-with": "main"
    }
  }
}]
~~~

You'll then receive subscription responses as files change; those responses
will contain *fat clock* values for the `since` and `clock` fields:

~~~json
{
  "subscription": "mysubscriptionname",
  "clock": {
    "clock": "c:1234:125",
    "scm": {
      "mergebase": "fabf87",
      "mergebase-with": "main",
    }
  },
  "since": {
    "clock": "c:1234:123",
    "scm": {
      "mergebase": "f12345",
      "mergebase-with": "main",
    }
  },
  "files": ["cat.jpg", "cats.cpp"],
  "root":  "/path/to/root"
}
~~~

The `clock` field holds the value of the clock and the merge base as of the subscription
notification.

The `since` field holds the *fat clock* that was returned in the `clock` field from
the prior subscription update.  It is present as a convenience for you; you can compare
the `mergebase` fields between the two to determine that the merge base changed in
this update.  This is an important detail because more files in the working copy have
been physically changed than are reflected in the `files` list; your tooling will need
to so something appropriate to ensure that it computes a consistent and correct result.

### `state-enter` & `state-leave`

Source control aware subscriptions will always include a *fat clock* in their responses, however,
only the regular clock is provided in `state-enter` and `state-leave` notifications.
This is because computing the source control information is a non-trivial operation and
could increase latency.
