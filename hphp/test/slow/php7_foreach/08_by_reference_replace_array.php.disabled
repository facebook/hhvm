<?php
/* The below example appears in the php7_foreach RFC, with the expectation that
 * it will output 1, then 4, then stop. This is actually documenting a bug in
 * both php5 and php7.
 *
 * The reason the RFC contains both 06_by_reference_add_element.php and
 * 07_by_reference_add_element_while_at_end.php is that the former worked in
 * php5, but the latter did not; in php7 both work. However, while appending
 * to the current array while at the end of it was fixed, replacing the array
 * while at the end of it remains broken. If you modify this test case by
 * initializing $b = [3,4,5]; instead, then all versions (php5, php7 and hhvm)
 * will output 1, then loop forever outputting 4 (like they should with this
 * one, but which only hhvm does).
 *
 * See also extra_by_reference_replace_array_at_end.php for a clearer example
 * of why this behavior matters.
