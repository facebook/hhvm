   * because sync_regstate in unwind-itanium.cpp doesn't know how to
   * clean them.
   *
   * So the best we can do is to set vmfp() to the ActRec of the
   * function that was just called, vmpc() to the start of the
   * function, and vmsp() to the last parameter pushed(), and then
   * throw a special exception so the unwinder knows what to do.
   *
   * Since we want to raise the exception as if it were raised in the
   * caller, its tempting to set things up to calleeAR->sfp(), but
   * there are two problems: this could be the first frame in a VM
   * re-entry, and our caller might be inlined.
   *
   * In the first case, setting vmfp() to a frame in a prior vm
   * invocation will confuse things, and in the latter, our caller's
   * frame might not be linked into the call chain until we run the
   * catch trace corresponding to this call.
   *
   * We can solve both problems by throwing a special exception here,
   * and dealing with it after unwinding the whole vm entry.

   * Stack overflows in this situation are a slightly different case than
   * handleStackOverflow:
   *
   * A function prologue already did all the work to prepare to enter the
   * function, but then it found out it didn't have enough room on the stack.
   * It may even have written uninits deeper than the stack base (but we limit
   * it to sSurprisePageSize, so it's harmless).
   *
   * Most importantly, it might have pulled args /off/ the eval stack and
   * shoved them into an ExtraArgs on the calleeAR, or into an array for a
   * variadic capture param.  We need to get things into an appropriate state
   * for handleStackOverflow to be able to synchronize things to throw from the
   * PC of the caller's FCall.
   *
   * We don't actually need to make sure the stack is the right depth for the
   * FCall: the unwinder will expect to see a pre-live ActRec (and we'll set it
   * up so it will), but it doesn't care how many args (or what types of args)
   * are below it on the stack.
   *
   * It is tempting to try to free the ExtraArgs structure here, but it's ok to
   * not to:
   *
   *     o We're about to raise an uncatchable fatal, which will end the
   *       request.  We leak ExtraArgs in other similar situations for this too
   *       (e.g. if called via FCall with unpack and then a stack overflow
   *       happens).
   *
   *     o If we were going to free the ExtraArgs structure, we'd need to make
   *       sure we can re-enter the VM right now, which means performing a
   *       manual fixup first.  (We aren't in a situation where we can do a
   *       normal VMRegAnchor fixup right now.)  But moreover we shouldn't be
   *       running destructors if a fatal is happening anyway, so we don't want
   *       that either.
   *
   * So, all that boils down to this: we ignore the extra args field (the
   * unwinder will not consult the ExtraArgs field because it believes the
   * ActRec is pre-live).  And set calleeAR->m_numArgs to indicate how many
   * things are actually on the stack (so handleStackOverflow knows what to set
   * the vmsp to)---we just set it to the function's numLocals, which might
   * mean decreffing some uninits unnecessarily, but that's ok.
