This is a sketchy null check.
It detects nulls, but it will also detect many other falsy values, including `false`, `0`, `0.0`, `""`, `"0"`, empty Containers, and more.
If you want to test for them, please consider doing so explicitly.
If you only meant to test for `null`, use `$x ?? $default` instead of `$x ?: $default` (Lint[5618])
File "null_check_strict3.php", line 6, characters 8-9:
Sketchy condition: testing the truthiness of a string may not behave as expected.
The values `""` and `"0"` are both considered falsy. To check for emptiness, use `Str\is_empty`. (Lint[5623])
