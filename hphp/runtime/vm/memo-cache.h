/*
 * Memoization cache support
 *
 * Memoization caches are used to support functions marked <<__Memoize>> and can
 * either be in RDS (for static functions) or hung-off ObjectData* (for
 * methods).
 *
 * All memo caches map some set of keys (which are only integers or strings) to
 * a particular TypedValue value. Caches can either be non-shared or shared. A
 * non-shared cache is for exactly one function, and the keys (corresponding to
 * the parameters) is all that's necessary to lookup the value. Non-shared
 * caches are used for static functions, and (as an optimization) on methods for
 * classes with few memoized functions. A shared cache can be used by different
 * functions, and therefore stores an additional key value distinguishing that
 * function (the form of this key varies by the cache type).
 *
 * Memo caches are only manipulated via their associated getter and setter
 * functions. Getter functions receive a pointer to MemoCacheBase, a pointer to
 * an array of Cells (which must be integers or strings) representing the
 * parameters, and, if shared, some additional value distinguishing that
 * function. If the value is found, a pointer to it is returned. If not, or if
 * the pointer to the cache is null, null is returned. No ref-count manipulation
 * is done in the returned value. Setter functions receive a *reference* to a
 * pointer to MemoCacheBase, a pointer to an array of Cells, if shared, an
 * additional value distinguishing that function, and a TypedValue to store in the
 * cache. The TypedValue is stored in the cache, and its ref-count is incremented
 * (with any previous value being dec-reffed and overwritten). If the pointer to
 * the cache was null, a new cache is allocated, and the pointer is updated to
 * point at it.
 *
 * For optimization, there's a number of specialized memo-caches. These are
 * specialized on a specific number of keys, and perhaps the types of
 * keys. These specializations are not exposed directly, but instead you call a
 * function to obtain the appropriate getter and setter. For a particular memo
 * cache, the same specialized get/set function must always be used! It is not
 * legal to sometimes use a specialized get/set function it, and a generic one
 * elesewhere.
 */

namespace HPHP {

/*
 * The actual implementation of the memo-caches are private to memo-cache.cpp
 * (since they involve a lot of templates). The rest of the runtime interacts
 * with them via a pointer to this base class. The set functions will create a
 * new memo-cache if the pointer is null, and update the pointer. We can destroy
 * them polymorphically when releasing an ObjectData, so the destructor must be
 * virtual.

/*
 * Specialized getters and setters
 *
 * Up to certain limits, we have specialized caches for specific key counts and
 * key types. The exact nature of these specializations is an implementation
 * detail, so instead of enumerating the all appropriate get/set functions here,
 * we provide an interface to get the appropriate function pointer.
 *
 * Each "flavor" has a "GetForKeyTypes" and "GetForKeyCount" lookup
 * function. The first is for when you know the specific types of the keys. Keys
 * can only be integers or strings, and the types are represented by an array of
 * booleans, where true means string. If you don't know the specific types, one
 * can use "GetForKeyCount" to obtain a function specialized on just the key
 * count (Key type specialized and key count specialized get/set functions can
 * be interchanged freely on the same memo cache). If the function returns null,
 * there's no specialization available and one has to use a generic cache.
 *
 * For the shared-case, a FuncId is used to distinguish functions. A key-count
 * of zero never has a specialized representation here. It makes no sense for
 * the non-shared case, and the shared case should just use "shared-only"
 * caches.
