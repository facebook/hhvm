description: >
  Enable support for 48-bit signed "fastint" integer values.  Fastints are
  transparent to user code (both C and Ecmascript) but may be faster than
  IEEE doubles on some platforms, especially those using softints.  The
  downside of fastints is increased code footprint and a small performance
  penalty for some kinds of code.
