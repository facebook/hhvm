description: >
  Use _setjmp/_longjmp for long control transfers.  This ensures signal
  mask is not saved which can be a lot faster if setjmp/longjmp saves the
  signal mask (this varies between platforms).  See comments in
  DUK_USE_SETJMP.

  Removed in Duktape 1.5.0: edit duk_config.h directly.
