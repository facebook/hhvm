1. What is taint / data flow analysis?
======================================

The purpose of doing data flow analysis is to keep track of the origin of
strings. When taint analysis is enabled, each php string contains a few extra
bits of information. These bits can be set in various strings and each operation
will either clear, set or propagate the bits.

The goal of taint analysis is to detect/prevent security issues. It can be used
as a defense against XSS and SQL injections. It can also be used to harden
things like curl, eval, exec by failing to process strings which are controlled
by the user.

For example, to prevent XSS bugs, we can taint every string in the $_GET,
$_POST, $_COOKIE and $_SERVER arrays. We can then clear the taint when specific
sanitization functions are called and propagate the taint in all other cases. We
then simply need to check the taint while echoing the string to detect XSS bugs.



2. Compiling HPHP with Taint enabled
====================================

Edit your hphp/local/<your_unixname>.mk file to contain the following flags:
DEBUG = 1
TAINTED = 1

Then do make clobber; make -j

Voila :)



3. Taint analysis in HPHP
=========================

After evaluating several possible implementations, we decided to implement a
TaintObserver object which keeps tracks of which strings are being read. When
a string is created or mutated, the TaintObserver will tell us if the new string
needs to be tainted or not.

The advantage of this approach is that we don't need to convert the entire hphp
codebase to be taint aware. It also means we can continue using raw char*
operations in places like src/runtime/base/zend/zend_string.cpp.

On the other hand, the disadvantage is that functions like addcslashes will
return a tainted string even if only the second parameter is tainted. In
practice, this does not matter and we can live with this false negative.

We modified idl/base.php to instantiate a TaintObserver for each php function.
The code is designed to support multiple TaintObservers. Each TaintObserver
lives on the stack. At any given time, the newest TaintObserver is handling
the taint. When a TaintObserver falls out of scope, the previous
TaintObserver goes back to handling things.



4. Overview of taint related code
=================================

All the taint related code lives in src/runtime/base/taint/.

HPHP has the following classes which represent strings:
- String: a smart pointer to StringData
- AtomicString: a smart pointer to StringData
- StaticString: a smart pointer to StringData
- Variant: a container which sometimes contains StringData
- StringData
- StringBuffer

We only keep track of the taint bits in StringData and StringBuffer,
since those two classes actually hold the char* data. Everything else
is just a layer of indirection which we can ignore.

4.1. taint_observer.h / taint_observer.cpp
==========================================

Keeps track of which strings are being accessed and when a string is mutated,
the TaintObserver will propagate the taint.

We can't get StringData and StringBuffer to inherit from a single ITaintable
interface, because of the FAST_REFCOUNT_FOR_VARIANT optimization. We therefore
use method overloading.

TaintObserver's constructor takes a mask of bits to set and a mask of bits
to clear. If a bit is neither "set" nor "clear" it will propagate. The
current propagation rule is always an OR operation. E.g.:

To always set the HTML bit:       TaintObserver(0x01, 0x00);
To always clear the HTML bit:     TaintObserver(0x00, 0x01);
To always propagate the HTML bit: TaintObserver(0x00, 0x00);

4.2. taint_data.h / taint_data.cpp
==================================

The actual taint information we are adding to the strings. Currently it's only
an int, but this will expand to include additional metadata in the future.

It's important to keep in mind that each time an object which contains TaintData
is accessed, it needs to notify the TaintObserver. Each time an object which
contains TaintData is mutated, it also needs to call the TaintObserver so that
the correct taint bits can be set.

4.3. taint_helper.h / taint_helper.cpp
======================================

Helper code to taint arrays. Used from src/runtime/base/server/http_protocol.cpp
to taint the $_GET, $_POST, $_COOKIES and $_SERVER arrays.

Helper code to warn if a tainted string is being used.



5. Limitations of taint analysis
================================

5.1. Only strings are tainted
=============================

Taint analysis is performed at a string level. This means it's possible to loose
the taint in php code by using chr(ord()):

$s = '';
for ($i=0; $i<strlen($tainted_string); $i++) {
  $s .= chr(ord($tainted_string[$i]));
}

In general it's going to be hard to prevent malicious php code from clearing the
taint. HTML/XML sanitization is context dependant and we therefore currently
need to expose a fb_unset_taint method.

5.2. LinearAllocator
====================

The code currently does not deal with the LinearAllocator. If a string is
backed up to the LinearAllocator, it's taint state will be lost. Intuitively,
this should not impact taint analysis, because strings being saved in the
LinearAllocator should not be user supplied strings.

5.3. Thread local TaintObserver
===============================

Each tread has zero, one or more TaintObservers. These objects don't know about
each other's existence. If a shared string is tainted in a thread A, it might
cause thread B to incorrectly propagate the taint. Again, this should not
impact the usefulness of the taint analysis, because strings being shared
between threads should not be user supplied strings.



6. Future work
==============

Knowing if a string is tainted is useful, however we often also need to know
where/why a string was tainted. We are working on attaching this kind of
metadata to the taint bits.



7. TODO / Notes
===============

* Investigate if string_data assign needs to propagate the taint
* Check if flush() works as expected
* Add a test for ob_get_status and output buffer handlers
* Add more tests for str_replace, there's a lot going on there
* runtime/base/execution_context.cpp has calls to writeStdout. Make sure
  the right thing is happening there
* Right now, we are checking m_buffers.size() == 2 in execution_context.cpp.
  This will fail if output buffering is turned off. We need to find a better
  solution...
