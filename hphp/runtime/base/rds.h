/*
 * The RDS (Request Data Segment) is a region of memory quickly
 * accessible to each hhvm thread that is running a PHP request.
 *
 * Essentially this is a per-thread memory region, along with an
 * internal dynamic link table to give the segment the same layout for
 * each thread as new data is allocated.
 *
 * The RDS starts with a small header that is statically layed out,
 * followed by the main "normal" segment, which is initialized to zero
 * at the start of each request.  The next section, called "local",
 * contains unshared but still persistent data---this is data that is
 * local to a thread but retains its value across requests.  The final
 * section contains shared "persistent" data, which is data that
 * retains the same values across requests.
 *
 * The shared persistent segment is           RDS Layout:
 * implemented by mapping the same physical
 * pages to different virtual addresses, so      +-------------+ <-- tl_base
 * are all accessible from the                   |  Header     |
 * per-thread RDS base.  The normal              +-------------+
 * region is perhaps analogous to .bss,          |             |
 * while the persistent region is                |  Normal     |
 * analagous to .rodata, and the local region    |    region   |
 * is similar to .data.                          |             | growing higher
 *                                               +-------------+  vvv
 * When we're running in C++, the base of RDS    | \ \ \ \ \ \ |
 * is available via a thread local exported      +-------------+  ^^^
 * from this module (tl_base).  When running     |  Local      | growing lower
 * in JIT-compiled code, a machine register      |    region   |
 * is reserved to always point at the base of    +-------------+
 * RDS.                                          | Persistent  |
 *                                               |     region  | higher
 *                                               +-------------+   addresses
 *
 *
 * Allocation/linking API:
 *
 *   You can allocate data from RDS in two primary ways, either by
 *   binding a Link, or anonymously.  The distinction is whether the
 *   allocated space is associated with some unique key that allows it
 *   to be re-found for any new attempts to allocate that symbol.
 *
 *   Anonymous allocations are created with RDS::alloc.  Non-anonymous
 *   allocations can be created in two ways:
 *
 *     RDS::bind(Symbol) uses an RDS-internal link table to find if
 *     there is an existing handle for the given symbol.
 *
 *     RDS::Link<T>::bind allows the caller to make use of the
 *     uniqueness of other runtime structure (e.g. the Class
 *     structure) to avoid having a special key and needing to do
 *     lookups in the internal RDS link table.  The "key" for the
 *     allocation is the RDS::Link<> object itself.
 *
 *   Finally, you can allocate anonymous single bits at a time with
 *   allocBit().
