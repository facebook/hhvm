 * random numbers.
 *
 * RNG also implements the boost random number generator interface, so it can
 * be used as an engine for boost random distributions.
 *
 *
 * This class is essentially just a wrapper around boost::mt19937.
 * We have to wrap it because some of the boost code copy-constructs the
 * generators, causing the state of the original generator to never be updated.
 * (In particular uniform_01 copy constructs its generator argument, and
 * variate_generator may end up using uniform_01.)
 *
 * It's rather annoying that we have to define our own wrapper class for this.
