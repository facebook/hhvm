This is a point-in-time snapshot of the API documentation from January 2026.
Going forward, we will not be maintaining a public copy of these references,
and recommend users to refer to the built-in signature helpers available in
the Hack LSP instead for complete and up-to-date information.
:::

## Examples




The string version of a [` Set `](/apis/Classes/HH/Set/) is always `` "Set" ``:

echo $s->__toString()."\n";

$s2 = Set {'a', 'b', 'c'};
echo $s2->__toString()."\n";

$s3 = Set {};
echo $s3->__toString()."\n";
```
