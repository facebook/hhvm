(*
 We have a lambda in hand, and the chain of parents in its parse tree.
We wish to know all the local variables which appear immediately in any parent
that are used anywhere inside the lambda. These are the "outer variables" of
the lambda.

This is trickier than it sounds.  Consider the first lambda here:

function foo($a, $e) {
  $b = 123;
  m(
    ($b, $c, $f) ==> m($a, $b, $c, () ==> { ... $d = $e ... }),
    () ==> { ... $d = $b; ... });
}

* $a is an outer variable of the lambda; it appears outside and is used inside.
* $b is not an outer variable of the lambda. It appears outside, but the $b used
  inside the lambda is a different $b.
* $c is not an outer variable of the lambda; it does not appear outside.
* $d is not an outer variable of the lambda, even though it appears outside
  the lambda and is used inside the lambda.
* $e is an outer variable; it appears outside, and is used indirectly inside.
* $f is not an outer variable; it does not appear outside.

The first problem we're going to solve is finding all the variables used
*without recursing into child lambdas*. Variables which are declared as formal
parameters are considered used; they are implicitly assigned a value.

For our example above:

* the variables used by foo are $a, $b and $e
* the variables used by the first lambda are $a, $b, $c, $f
* the variables used by the second lambda are $d and $e
* the variables used by the third lambda are $b and $d

TODO: We need to figure out how to make cases like

{
  $x = 123;
  ... () ==> "${x}" ...
}

work correctly. String identity on locals doesn't really work here.
