(** Note: the tracking in this module is best effort only;
 * it's not guaranteed to always reflect accurate merge base transitions:
 * - in some init types, initial merge base is not known so we will only notice
 *   the second transition
 * - to avoid blocking rest of the system, mergebase queries time out after 30
 *   seconds and are not retried in case of errors
 * - we only record "new" mergebases as we see them, not detecting transitions
 *   between already visited revisions

      (**  Do we think that this server have processed a mergebase change? If we are
        * in this state and get notified about changes to a huge number of files (or
        * even small number of files that fan-out to a huge amount of work), we might
       * decide that restarting the server is a better option than going through with
       * incremental processing (See ServerLocalConfig.hg_aware_*_restart_threshold).
       * It is likely to be faster because:
       * - a better saved state might be available
       * - even with same saved state, during init we can treat all those changes
       *   (if they were indeed due to non-local commits ) as prechecked (see ServerPrecheckedFiles)
       *    and avoid processing them.
       * There is some room for false positives, when small inconsequential rebase is immediately
       * followed by a big local change, but that seems unlikely to happen often compared to
       * the hours we waste processing incremental rebases.
