  Abandon array part if its density is below L.  The limit L is expressed as
  a .3 fixed point point, e.g. 2 means 2/8 = 25%.

  The default limit is quite low: one array entry with packed duk_tval is 8
  bytes whereas one normal entry is 4+1+8 = 13 bytes without a hash entry,
  and 17-21 bytes with a hash entry (load factor 0.5-1.0).  So the array part
  shouldn't be abandoned very easily from a footprint point of view.
