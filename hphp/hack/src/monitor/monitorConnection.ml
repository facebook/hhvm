      * has wedged itself (a bug).
      *
      * The DDOS occurs when the Monitor's new connections (arriving on
      * the socket) queue grows faster than they are being processed. This can
      * happen in two scenarios:
        * 1) Malicious DDOSer fills up new connection queue (incoming
        *    connections on the socket) quicker than the queue is being
        *    consumed.
        * 2) New client connections to the monitor are being created by the
        *    retry logic in hh_client faster than those cancelled connections
        *    (cancelled due to the timeout above) are being discarded by the
        *    monitor. This could happen from thousands of hh_clients being
        *    used to parallelize a job. This is effectively an inadvertent DDOS.
        *    In detail, suppose the timeout above is set to 1 ssecond and that
        *    1000 thousand hh_client have timed out at the line above. Then these
        *    1000 clients will cancel the connection and retry. But the Monitor's
        *    connection queue still has these dead/canceled connections waiting
        *    to be processed. Suppose it takes the monitor longer than 1
        *    millisecond to handle and discard a dead connection. Then the
        *    1000 retrying hh_clients will again add another 1000 dead
        *    connections during retrying even tho the monitor has discarded
        *    fewer than 1000 dead connections. Thus, no progress will be made
        *    on clearing out dead connections and all new connection attempts
        *    will time out.
        *
        *    We ameliorate this by having the timeout be quite large
        *    (many seconds) and by not auto-retrying connections to the Monitor.

(** connect_once.
1. OPEN SOCKET. After this point we have a working stdin/stdout to the
process. Implemented in establish_connection.
  | catch EConnRefused/ENoEnt/Timeout 1s when lockfile present ->
    Error Monitor_socket_not_ready.
      This is unexpected! But can happen if you manage to catch the
      monitor in the short timeframe after it has grabbed its lock but
      before it has started listening in on its socket.
      -> "hh_client check/ide" -> retry from step 1, up to 800 times.
         The number 800 is hard-coded in 9 places through the codebase.
      -> "hh_client start" -> print "replacing unresponsive server"
             kill_server; start_server; exit.
  | catch Timeout <retries>s when lockfile present ->
    Error Monitor_establish_connection_timeout
      This is unexpected! after all the monitor is always responsive,
      and indeed start_server waits until responsive before returning.
      But this can happen during a DDOS.
      -> "hh_client check/ide" -> Its retry attempts are passed to the
          monitor connection attempt already. So in this timeout all
          the retries have already been consumed. Just exit.
      -> "hh_client start" -> print "replacing unresponsive server"
             kill_server; start_server; exit.
  | catch EConnRefused/ENoEnt/Timeout when lockfile absent ->
    Error Server_missing.
      -> "hh_client ide" -> raise Exit_with IDE_no_server.
      -> "hh_client check" -> start_server; retry step 1, up to 800x.
      -> "hh_client start" -> start_server; exit.
  | catch other exception -> unhandled.

2. SEND VERSION; READ VERSION; CHECK VERSIONS. After this point we can
safely marshal OCaml types back and forth. Implemented in get_cstate
and verify_cstate.
  | catch any exception when lockfile present ->
    close_connection; Error Monitor_connection_failure.
      This is unexpected!
      -> "hh_client check/ide" -> retry from step 1, up to 800 times.
      -> "hh_client start" -> print "replacing unresponsive server"
             kill_server; start_server; exit.
  | catch any exception when lockfile absent ->
    close_connection; Error Server_missing.
      -> "hh_client ide" -> raise Exit_with IDE_no_server
      -> "hh_client check" -> start_server; retry step 1, up to 800x.
      -> "hh_client start" -> start_server; exit.
  | if version numbers differ ->
    Error Build_mismatch.
      -> "hh_client ide" -> raise Exit_with IDE_no_server.
      -> "hh_client check" -> close_log_tailer; retry from step 1.
      -> "hh_client start" -> start_server; exit.

3. SEND HANDOFF; READ RESPONSE. After this point we have a working
connection to a server who we believe is ready to handle our messages.
Handoff is the stage of the protocol when we're speaking to the monitor
rather than directly to the server process itself. Implemented in
send_server_handoff_rpc and consume_prehandoff_message.
  | response Server_name_not_found ->
    raise Exit_with Server_name_not_found.
  | response Server_not_alive_dormant ->
    print "Waiting for server to start"; retry step 5, unlimited times.
  | response Server_dormant_connections_limit_reached ->
    Error Server_dormant.
      -> "hh_client ide" -> raise Exit_with IDE_no_server.
      -> "hh_client start" -> print "Server already exists but is
        dormant"; exit.
      -> "hh_client check" -> print "No server running, and connection
        limit reached for waiting  on the next server to be started.
        Please wait patiently." raise Exit_with No_server_running.
  | response Server_died ->
    print "Last killed by OOM / signal / stopped by signal / exited";
    wait for server to close; Error Server_died.
      -> "hh_client ide" -> raise Exit_with IDE_no_server.
      -> "hh_client start" -> start_server.
      -> "hh_client check" -> retry from step 1, up to 800 times.
  | catch any exception -> unhandled.

The following two steps aren't implemented inside connect_once but are
typically done by callers after connect_once has succeeded...

4. READ "HELLO" FROM SERVER. After this point we have evidence that the
server is ready to handle our messages. We basically gobble whatever
the server sends until it finally sends a line with just "hello".
Implemented in wait_for_server_hello.
  | read anything other than "hello" -> retry from step 4, up to 800x.
  | catch Timeout 1s -> retry from step 4, up to 800 times.
  | catch exception EndOfFile/Sys_error ->
    raise ServerHungUp.
      -> "hh_client ide/check" -> program exit, code=No_server_running.
      -> clientStart never actually bothers to do step 4.
  | catch other exception -> unhandled.

5. SEND CONNECTION TYPE; READ RESPONSE. After this point we have
evidence that the server is able to handle our connection. The
connection type indicates Persistent vs Non-persistent.
  | response Denied_due_to_existing_persistent_connection.
      -> "hh_client lsp" -> raise Lsp.Error_server_start.
  | catch any exception -> unhandled.
