# Building using `fbcode_builder`

Continuous integration builds are powered by `fbcode_builder`, a tiny tool
shared by several Facebook projects.  Its files are in `./fbcode_builder`
(on Github) or in `fbcode/opensource/fbcode_builder` (inside Facebook's
repo).

Start with the READMEs in the `fbcode_builder` directory.

`./fbcode_builder_config.py` contains the project-specific configuration.
