# Keywords

Keywords are reserved; they should not and usually *cannot* be used as names. Other words that shouldn't be used for names are the [built-in types](/hack/built-in-types/introduction).

## Keywords
```Hack no-extract
abstract   as   async   attribute   await   break   case   catch   category   children
class   classname   clone   const   continue   default   do   echo   else   enum   eval
exit   extends   final   finally   for   foreach   function   if   implements   include
include_once   inout   interface   invariant   isset   list   namespace   new   newtype
noreturn   parent   print   private   protected   public   require   required
require_once   return   self   shape   super   static   switch   throw   trait   try
tuple   type   unset   use   using   where   while   yield
```

## Deprecated Keywords
In addition, the following keywords are reserved for historical / future usage:

```Hack no-extract
and   declare   die   elseif   empty   enddeclare   endfor   endforeach   endif
endswitch   endwhile   global   goto   instanceof   insteadof   or   record   var   xor
```
