# Do

The general format of a `do` statement is

`do` *statement* `while (` *expression* `);`

The *single* statement is executed.  If the expression tests `true`, the process is repeated. If the expression tests `false`, control transfers
to the point immediately following the end of the `do` statement. The loop body (that is, the single statement) is executed one or more times.
Consider the following:

```hack
$i = 1;
do {
  echo "$i\t".($i * $i)."\n"; // output a table of squares
  ++$i;
} while ($i <= 10);
```

The execution of a `do` statement is impacted by a subordinate
[`break` or `continue`](/hack/statements/break-and-continue).

The controlling expression must have type `bool` or a type that can be converted implicitly to `bool`.  For example, in `do` ... `while (1);`
`do` ... `while (123);` and `do` ... `while (-1.234e24)`, in each case, the value of the expression is non-zero, which is implicitly converted
to `true`.  Only zero-values are converted to `false`.

The `do` statement behaves slightly differently than `while` in that the former executes the loop body *before* it tests the controlling
expression, whereas `while` executes it after.
