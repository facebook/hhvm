/*
 * The RDS (Request Data Segment) is a region of memory quickly accessible to
 * each hhvm thread that is running a PHP request.
 *
 * Essentially this is a per-thread memory region, along with an internal
 * dynamic link table to give the segment the same layout for each thread as
 * new data is allocated.
 *
 * The RDS starts with a small header that is statically layed out, followed by
 * the main "normal" segment, which is (logically) reset at the beginning of
 * every request. The next section, called "local", contains unshared but still
 * persistent data---this is data that is local to a thread but retains its
 * value across requests.  The final section contains shared "persistent" data,
 * which is data that retains the same values across requests.
 *
 * The shared persistent segment is           RDS Layout:
 * implemented by mapping the same physical
 * pages to different virtual addresses, so      +-------------+ <-- tl_base
 * are all accessible from the                   |  Header     |
 * per-thread RDS base.  The normal              +-------------+
 * region is perhaps analogous to .bss,          |             |
 * while the persistent region is                |  Normal     |
 * analogous to .rodata, and the local region    |    region   |
 * is similar to .data.                          |             | growing higher
 *                                               +-------------+  vvv
 * When we're running in C++, the base of RDS    | \ \ \ \ \ \ |
 * is available via a thread local exported      +-------------+  ^^^
 * from this module (tl_base).  When running     |  Local      | growing lower
 * in JIT-compiled code, a machine register      |    region   |
 * is reserved to always point at the base of    +-------------+
 * RDS.                                          | Persistent  |
 *                                               |     region  | higher
 *                                               +-------------+   addresses
 *
 * Every element in the "normal" segment has an associated generation number,
 * and the segment as a whole has a "current" generation number.  A particular
 * element is considered initialized if its generation number matches the
 * segment's current generation number.  If it does not, the element should be
 * considered to contain garbage and should be initialized as needed by the
 * element type.  Once done, it must be manually marked as initialized.
 *
 * Allocation/linking API:
 *
 *   You can allocate data from RDS in two primary ways, either by
 *   binding a Link, or anonymously.  The distinction is whether the
 *   allocated space is associated with some unique key that allows it
 *   to be re-found for any new attempts to allocate that symbol.
 *
 *   Anonymous allocations are created with rds::alloc.  Non-anonymous
 *   allocations can be created in two ways:
 *
 *     rds::bind(Symbol) uses an RDS-internal link table to find if
 *     there is an existing handle for the given symbol.
 *
 *     rds::Link<T>::bind allows the caller to make use of the
 *     uniqueness of other runtime structure (e.g. the Class
 *     structure) to avoid having a special key and needing to do
 *     lookups in the internal RDS link table.  The "key" for the
 *     allocation is the rds::Link<> object itself.
 *
 *   Finally, you can allocate anonymous single bits at a time with
 *   allocBit().
 *
