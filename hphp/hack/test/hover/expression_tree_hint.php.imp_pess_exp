class ExampleDsl
~ExprTree<ExampleDsl, mixed, TInfer#1>
where TInfer#1 = ExampleString
An example DSL for testing expression trees (ETs).

Any class can be used an an expression tree visitor. It needs to implement
the methods shown here, and expression tree literals MyClass`...` will be
converted (at compile time) to calls on these methods.

This .hhi file is only used when testing the type checker. Otherwise
every test file would need to include a class with all these methods.
