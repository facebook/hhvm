(** This function does an rpc to the daemon: it pushes a message
onto the daemon's stdin queue, then awaits until [serve] has stuck
the stdout response from the daemon response onto our [response_emitter].
The daemon updates [ref_unblocked_time], the time at which the
daemon starting handling the rpc.

The progress callback will be invoked during this call to rpc, at times
when the result of [get_status t] might have changed. It's designed
so the caller of rpc can, in their callback, invoke get_status and display
some kind of progress message.

Note: it is safe to call this method even while an existing rpc
is outstanding - we guarantee that results will be delivered in order.

Note: it is not safe to cancel this method, since we might end up
with no one reading the response to the message we just pushed, leading
to desync.

Note: If we're in Stopped state (due to someone calling [stop]) then
we'll refrain from sending the rpc. Stopped is the only state we enter
due to our own volition; all other states are just a reflection
of what state the daemon is in, and so it's fine for the daemon
to respond as it see fits while in the other states. *)

      (* Discussion about why the following is safe, even if multiple people call rpc:
      Imagine `let%lwt x = rpc(X) and y = rpc(Y)`.
      We will therefore push X onto the [messages_to_send] queue, then
      await [Lwt_message_queue.pop] on [response_emitter] for a response to X,
      then we'll push Y onto the queue, then await pop for a response to Y.
      The [messages_to_send] queue will necessarily send them in order X,Y.
      The daemon will receive X,Y in order.
      The daemon will handle X first (the daemon only handles a single message
      at a time) and send it response, then handle Y next and send its response.
      Our [serve] will read the responses to X,Y in order and put them onto
      [response_emitter].
      Why will "pop x" wake up and pick an element before "pop y" even though
      they're both waiting? The crucial fact is that "pop x" was called
      before "pop y". And [Lwt_message_queue.pop] is built upon
      [Lwt_condition.wait], which in turn is built upon [Lwt_sequence.t]:
      It maintains an ordered queue of callers who are awaiting on pop,
      and when a new item arrives then it wakes up the first one. *)
