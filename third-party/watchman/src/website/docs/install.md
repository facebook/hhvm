## System Requirements

Watchman is known to compile and pass its test suite on:

 * <i class="fa fa-linux"></i> Linux systems with `inotify`
 * <i class="fa fa-apple"></i> macOS (uses `FSEvents` on 10.7+,
   `kqueue(2)` on earlier versions)
 * <i class="fa fa-windows"></i> Windows 10 (64-bit) and up. Windows 7 support is provided by community patches

Watchman used to support the following systems, but no one is actively
maintaining them.  The core of the code should be OK, but they likely don't
build.  We'd love it if someone would step forward to maintain them:

 * BSDish systems (FreeBSD 9.1, OpenBSD 5.2) that have the
   `kqueue(2)` facility
 * Illumos and Solaris style systems that have `port_create(3C)`

Watchman relies on the operating system facilities for file notification,
which means that you will likely have very poor results using it on any
kind of remote or distributed filesystem.

Watchman does not currently support any other operating system not covered by
the list above.

## Windows

### Prebuilt Binaries

1. Download and extract the windows release from the [latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest)
2. It will be named something like `watchman-vYYYY.MM.DD.00-windows.zip`
3. It contains a `bin` folder.  Move that somewhere appropriate and update your `PATH` environment to reference that location.

If you encounter issues with the Windows version of watchman, please report
them via GitHub!  [You can find the list of known Windows issues here](
https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+Windows).

### Installing via Chocolatey

Watchman is available via the [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/watchman) Windows package manager.  Installation is as simple as:

```powershell
PS C:\> choco install watchman
```

The package is maintained by the community rather than by Meta, so if you experience issues with installation or uninstallation,
you should [contact the package maintainers](https://chocolatey.org/packages/watchman/ContactOwners) for assistance.

## macOS

### <a name="homebrew-instructions"></a> Homebrew

Homebrew's [Watchman package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/watchman#default) is community-maintained, but it works well for many.

```sh
$ brew update
$ brew install watchman
```

If for some reason you can't wait for the Homebrew package to update,
you can install the latest build from GitHub:

```sh
$ brew install --HEAD watchman
```

### <a name="macports"></a> MacPorts

To install the package maintained by [MacPorts](https://ports.macports.org/port/watchman/):

```bash
$ sudo port install watchman
```

### Prebuilt Binaries

1. Download and extract the macOS release from the [latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest)
2. It will be named something like `watchman-vYYYY.MM.DD.00-macos.zip`

```bash
$ unzip watchman-*-macos.zip
$ cd watchman-vYYYY.MM.DD.00-macos
$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/{bin,lib} /usr/local/var/run/watchman
$ sudo cp bin/* /usr/local/bin
$ sudo cp lib/* /usr/local/lib
$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/watchman
$ sudo chmod 2777 /usr/local/var/run/watchman
```

The Watchman binaries are not signed, so manual approval in Security & Privacy in System Preferences may be necessary.

## Linux

### Homebrew

If you use Homebrew on Linux, it's a great way to get a recent Watchman build.

Follow the [macOS instructions above](#homebrew-instructions).

### Fedora (Prebuilt RPMs)

**Warning**: Do not install the Fedora-supplied Watchman package. It is old and missing security, bug, and performance fixes.

1. From the [latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest), download the .rpm corresponding to your Fedora version
2. `sudo dnf localinstall watchman-$VERSION.fc$FEDORA_VERSION.x86_64.rpm`
3. Confirm successful installation by running `watchman version`

### Ubuntu (Prebuilt Debs)

**Warning**: Do not install the Ubuntu-supplied Watchman package. It is old and missing security, bug, and performance fixes.

1. From the [latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest), download the .deb corresponding to your Ubuntu version
2. `sudo dpkg -i watchman_$UBUNTU_RELEASE_$VERSION.deb`
3. You will likely see errors about unresolved dependencies. The next step will resolve them.
4. `sudo apt-get -f install`
5. Confirm successful installation by running `watchman version`

### <a name="building-from-source"></a> Building from Source

Download a [source snapshot from the latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest) or [clone from GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/).

```bash
$ cd watchman

# Ensure Cargo is installed. Either through your OS's package manager or https://rustup.rs/
$ cargo version

# Optionally, to save time, you can ask Watchman's build process to install system dependencies
$ sudo ./install-system-packages.sh

$ ./autogen.sh
```

### Prebuilt Binaries

**Note**: Our binaries are built from the main branch only.  We don't provide binaries for v4.9.0.

**Note**: The Linux binaries are compiled on a GitHub Action VM (ubuntu-20.04 at the time of this writing),
and Linux binaries are [not generally compatible across distributions](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/issues/1019),
so try the prebuilt Fedora, Ubuntu, or Homebrew packages first.

Watchman is continuously deployed as it passes our internal test validation
inside Meta and doesn't use manually assigned or "approved" version numbers.

Outside Meta we have automation that cuts a tag and builds binaries on Monday of
each week and assigns a tag based on the date.  That process is in a beta
state; some or all of the binaries may not be present for any given tag.

1. Download and extract the release for your system from the [latest release](https://github.com/facebook/watchman/releases/latest)
2. It will be named something like `watchman-vYYYY.MM.DD.00-linux.zip`

```bash
$ unzip watchman-*-linux.zip
$ cd watchman-vYYYY.MM.DD.00-linux
$ sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/{bin,lib} /usr/local/var/run/watchman
$ sudo cp bin/* /usr/local/bin
$ sudo cp lib/* /usr/local/lib
$ sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/watchman
$ sudo chmod 2777 /usr/local/var/run/watchman
```

## System Specific Preparation

### Linux inotify Limits

The `inotify(7)` subsystem has three important tunings that impact watchman.

 * `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_instances` impacts how many different
   root dirs you can watch.
 * `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches` impacts how many dirs you
   can watch across all watched roots.
 * `/proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_queued_events` impacts how likely it is that
   your system will experience a notification overflow.

You obviously need to ensure that `max_user_instances` and `max_user_watches`
are set so that the system is capable of keeping track of your files.

`max_queued_events` is important to size correctly; if it is too small, the
kernel will drop events and watchman won't be able to report on them.  Making
this value bigger reduces the risk of this happening.

Watchman has two simple strategies for mitigating an overflow of
`max_queued_events`:

 * It uses a dedicated thread to consume kernel events as quickly as possible
 * When the kernel reports an overflow, watchman will assume that all the files
   have been modified and will re-crawl the directory tree as though it had just
   started watching the dir.

This means that if an overflow does occur, you won't miss a legitimate change
notification, but instead will get spurious notifications for files that
haven't actually changed.

### macOS File Descriptor Limits

*Only applicable on macOS 10.6 and earlier*

The default per-process descriptor limit on macOS is extremely low (256!).

Watchman will attempt to raise its descriptor limit to match
`kern.maxfilesperproc` when it starts up, so you shouldn't need to mess with
`ulimit`; just raising the sysctl should do the trick.

The following will raise the limits to allow 10 million files total, with 1
million files per process until your next reboot.

~~~bash
$ sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=10485760
$ sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=1048576
~~~

Putting the following into a file named `/etc/sysctl.conf` on macOS will cause
these values to persist across reboots:

~~~
kern.maxfiles=10485760
kern.maxfilesperproc=1048576
~~~
