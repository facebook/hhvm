{$title1}

I tripped on my shoelace
And I fell up--
Up to the roof tops,
Up over the town,
Up past the tree tops,
Up over the mountains,
Up where the colors
Blend into the sounds.
But it got me so dizzy
When I looked around,
I got sick to my stomach
And I threw down.

{$title2}

The little fish eats the tiny fish,
The big fish eats the little fish--
So only the biggest fish gets fat.
Do you know any folks like that?
