(* Scaling benchmarks for the shape-splat merge (Typing_shape_normalize.merge).
 *
 * Each scenario builds a splat of [n] elements and times the operation. Each
 * row reports the local exponent
 *   e = log (t_n / t_prev) / log (n / prev_n)
 * so e ~ 1 is linear and e ~ 2 is quadratic. Assertions use a log-log fit over
 * the largest sizes, with each time taken as the median of repeated samples.
 * The scenarios are chosen to isolate the two independent costs in a merge:
 *
 *   - the shape accumulator, exercised by the closed disjoint-field scenarios;
 *   - the disjointness accumulator (add_disjointness_operand), exercised by the
 *     generic / open / repeated-field scenarios, where nothing is merged into
 *     the shape accumulator at all.
 *
 * Run it directly to get the table:
 *   buck run @fbcode//mode/dev-nosan-lg \
 *     fbcode//hphp/hack/test/unit/typing:shapeSplatPerfTest -- \
 *     -runner sequential
