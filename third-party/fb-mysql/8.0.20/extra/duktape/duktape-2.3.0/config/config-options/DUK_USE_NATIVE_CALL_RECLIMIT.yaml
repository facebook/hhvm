  Maximum duk_handle_call() / duk_handle_safe_call() C recursion limit.
  Note that this does not limit bytecode executor internal call depth at
  all (e.g. for Ecmascript-to-Ecmascript calls, thread yields/resumes, etc).
  There is a separate callstack depth limit for threads which is independent
  of this limit.
