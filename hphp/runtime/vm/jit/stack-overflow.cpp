  /*
   * Stack overflows in this situation are a slightly different case than
   * handleStackOverflow:
   *
   * A function prologue already did all the work to prepare to enter the
   * function, but then it found out it didn't have enough room on the stack.
   * It may even have written uninits deeper than the stack base (but we limit
   * it to sSurprisePageSize, so it's harmless).
   *
   * Most importantly, it might have pulled args /off/ the eval stack and
   * shoved them into an array for a variadic capture param.  We need to get
   * things into an appropriate state for handleStackOverflow to be able to
   * synchronize things to throw from the PC of the caller's FCall.
   *
   * We don't actually need to make sure the stack is the right depth for the
   * FCall: the unwinder will expect to see a pre-live ActRec (and we'll set it
   * up so it will), but it doesn't care how many args (or what types of args)
   * are below it on the stack.
   *
   * So, all that boils down to this: we set calleeAR->m_numArgs to indicate
   * how many things are actually on the stack (so handleStackOverflow knows
   * what to set the vmsp to)---we just set it to the function's numLocals,
   * which might mean decreffing some uninits unnecessarily, but that's ok.
