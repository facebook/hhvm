   *
   * <p>Fork Join Pool Scheduler, backed by a fork join pool has increased scalability due to work
   * stealing algorithm where each thread has its own queue but can steal from other queues when its
   * own is empty. This reduces contention across threads.
   *
   * <p>Virtual Thread Scheduler, backed by a Virtual Thread Per Task Executor is available on Java
   * 19+. This can increase scalability over the fork join pool and thread pool executor by allowing
   * progress even when blocking (network/io) or locking. Virtual threads are psychically backed by
   * a system-wide fork join pool, but are able to unmount when blocking/locking allowing other work
   * to be done.
