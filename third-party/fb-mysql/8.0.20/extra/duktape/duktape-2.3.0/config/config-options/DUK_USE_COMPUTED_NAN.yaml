description: >
  The DUK_DOUBLE_NAN is not a constant but refers to a global variable with
  an IEEE NaN value computed at run-time.  Some compilers don't provide a
  constant for NaN, and may incorrectly evaluate (0 / 0) when doing
  constant folding.

  When enabled, define DUK_DOUBLE_NAN as duk_computed_nan.

# FIXME: remove computed NaN from Duktape itself and let user provide
# it instead?
