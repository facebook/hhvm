Cython wrappers of the C++ service classes that were generated by thrift.
By convention, service classes have a c in front of them to differentiate them
from the Python classes, which have no differentiation. That allows the Python
calling code to call into the code without any awkward prefixes or suffixes.

This is a top-level file that gets imported by the CythonServices.pyx file. That
file exposes Python wrappers of the services to the end user.
