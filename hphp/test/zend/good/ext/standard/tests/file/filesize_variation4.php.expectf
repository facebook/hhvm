*** Testing filesize(): usage variations ***

*** Testing filesize() with data written using different file modes and by creating holes in file ***
-- opening the file in 'w' mode and get the size --
int(192)
int(192)
-- opening the file in 'wt' mode and get the size --
int(192)
int(192)
-- opening the file in 'a' mode, adding data and checking the file --
int(204)
-- opening the file in 'at' mode, adding data and checking the file --
int(217)
-- creating a hole and checking the size --
bool(true)
int(220)
-- writing data after hole and checking the size --
int(226)
-- opening the existing file in write mode --
int(0)
-- with empty file --
int(0)
