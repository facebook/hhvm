       * Mixed, on the other hand, is only a supertype of everything. You need to do
       * a case analysis to figure out what it is (i.e., its elimination form).
       *

       * In contrast, if $x were annotated as mixed, adding one to that would be
       * a type error -- mixed is not a subtype of int, and you must be a subtype
       * of int to take part in addition. (The converse is true though -- int is a
       * subtype of mixed.) A case analysis would need to be done on $x, via
       * is_int or similar.
