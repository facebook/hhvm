/*
 * CLI Server
 *
 * This module hosts a server on a local socket which can be used to execute
 * PHP scripts. The server will delegate file system operations as well as
 * proc_open commands to the client, allowing the server to masquerade as the
 * client user.
 *
 * The main advantage here is that clients can share a single translation cache
 * and APC cache, and avoid paying the cost of hhvm startup with each script
 * invocation.
 *
 * Using the CLI server requires no changes to the permission model of the
 * server, and as privileged access is delegated to clients the risk of
 * privilege escalation within the server is minimized. Additionally the server
 * itself is only accessible via local socket, but can share a translation
 * cache with requests executing via the webserver.
 *
 * This server is still experimental and in particular there is very limited
 * transfer of configuration settings from the client. As a result scripts
 * executed via this module will be running with settings largely defined by
 * the server process. Currently PHP_INI_USER, PHP_INI_ALL, ServerVariables,
 * EnvVariables, and the remote environment are transferred.
 *
 * Access to the CLI server can be controlled by the runtime options
 * UnixServerAllowed{Users,Groups}. When both arrays are empty all users will
 * be allowed, otherwise only enumerated users and users with membership in
 * enumerated groups will be permitted access.
 *
 * Unit loading within the CLI server is controlled via two different runtime
 * options. Unlike ordinary file access the server will attempt to load all
 * units directly before falling back to the client.
 *
 * When UnixServerQuarantineUnits is set units not opened directly by the server
 * process will be written to a per-user unit cache only used for CLI server
 * requests by that user.
 *
 * When UnixServerVerifyExeAccess is set the server will verify that the client
 * can read each unit before loading them. The client is required to send the
 * server a read file descriptor for the unit, which the server will verify is
 * open in read mode using fcntl, has inode and device numbers matching those
 * seen by the server when executing stat.
 *
 * A UnixServerQuarantineApc is also available, which forces all apc operations
 * performed by the CLI server to use a per user cache not shared with the
 * webserver.
