# Test Simplifier

## Overview
Test simplifier reduces test script by comparing the results of running a php
script against two seperate command lines and removing statements from the
script until the results agree. It attempts to return the smallest possible php
script that still reproduces the inconsistent behavior. The output comparison
is based on stdout only.

The simplifier currently works at php statement granularity and will do an
exhaustive search of the possible programs created by removing statements from
the original.

## Usage

php simplifier.php [php script] [command 1] [command 2]

Example: comparing HHVM jit vs interp
php simplifier.php test/quick/ReadVar.php "hhvm -vEval.Jit=0 --file " "hhvm -vEval.Jit=1 --file "

This tools used PHP-Parser to parse php into an object
