/**
 * An asynchronous external thread event.
 *
 * A root class of all classes of objects representing events external to
 * the web request thread that synchronizes on them using ASIO framework.
 *
 * This is the preferred mechanism of I/O integration with ASIO framework.
 *
 * To implement a new class of such events, define a subclass that stores
 * information needed to unserialize result and provides a memory for storing
 * raw result. Then define a method that populates the result and marks
 * the event as finished, override unserialize method that will produce
 * result in the format understood by HHVM and implement destructor that
 * will clean up the stored data.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * struct FooEvent : AsioExternalThreadEvent {
 *   public:
 *     FooEvent(int max_value) : m_maxValue(max_value), m_failed(false) {}
 *     ~FooEvent() {}
 *     void setResult(int value) {
 *       m_value = value;
 *       markAsFinished();
 *     }
 *     void setException(const FooException& exception) {
 *       m_failed = true;
 *       markAsFinished();
 *     }
 *   protected:
 *     void unserialize(TypedValue& result) const {
 *       if (UNLIKELY(m_failed)) {
 *         SystemLib::throwInvalidOperationExceptionObject(
 *           "An error has occurred while scheduling the operation"
 *         );
 *       }
 *
 *       if (UNLIKELY(m_value > m_maxValue)) {
 *         SystemLib::throwInvalidOperationExceptionObject(
 *           "Invalid response returned by Foo backend"
 *         );
 *       }
 *
 *       tvDup(make_tv<KindOfInt64>(m_value), result);
 *     }
 *   private:
 *     int m_value, m_maxValue;
 *     bool m_failed;
 * };
 *
 * To use this mechanism from your extension, create an instance of the class,
 * schedule an asynchronous operation and return the wait handle to the caller.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Object f_gen_foo(int max_value) {
 *   // validate user input early
 *   if (max_value < 0) {
 *     SystemLib::throwInvalidArgumentExceptionObject(
 *       "Expected max_value to be non-negative"
 *     );
 *   }
 *
 *   FooEvent* event = new FooEvent(max_value);
 *   try {
 *     // make foo run asynchronously and eventually call event->setResult()
 *     foo_async_schedule(event);
 *   } catch (const FooException& exception) {
 *     // handle error while trying to schedule requested operation
 *     event->setException(exception);
 *   } catch (...) {
 *     // unknown exception; should be never reached
 *     assertx(false);
 *     event->abandon();
 *     SystemLib::throwInvalidOperationExceptionObject(
 *       "Encountered unexpected exception"
 *     );
 *   }
 *   return event->getWaitHandle();
 * }
 *
 * Caveats:
 *  - web request may die before the event is finished; never store pointers
 *    to any data owned by PHP as the PHP thread may die at any time
