 * Details: We have several instructions that conditionally define values on
 * their fallthrough edge.  If that edge goes to a block with other
 * predecessors, this function only returns that block if it also dominates
 * the sources of its other predecessors.  Otherwise, the value is only
 * really defined in that edge -- but in no block in the unit.
 *
 * A normal use for this function is when you have computed that an SSATmp has
 * the same value as another computation, but want to know if it is defined at
 * some program point so you can add a new use to it.  The precondition that
 * `t' is not the result of a DefConst is because this function makes no sense
 * for that instruction, which is used to produce values that are defined
 * everywhere.
