/**
 * Async generators are similar to
 * [PHP Generators](http://php.net/manual/en/language.generators.overview.php),
 * except that we are combining async with generators.
 *
 * An async generator is just like a normal generator with the addition of
 * allowing `await` statements in it because getting to the next yielded value
 * involves getting and awaiting on an `Awaitable`.
 *
 * WHILE THIS CLASS EXPOSES 3 METHODS, 99.9% OF THE TIME YOU WILL NOT USE THIS
 * CLASS DIRECTLY. INSTEAD, YOU WILL USE `await as` IN THE CODE USING YOUR
 * ASYNC GENERATOR. PLEASE READ THE GUIDE REFERENCED IN THIS API DOCUMENTATION
 * FOR MORE INFORMATION. However, we document these methods for completeness in
 * case you have a use case for them.
 *
 * There are three type parameters associated with an AsyncGenerator:
 * - `Tk`: The type of key returned by the generator
 * - `Tv`: The type of value returned by the generator
 * - `Ts`: The type that will be passed on a call to `send()`
 *
