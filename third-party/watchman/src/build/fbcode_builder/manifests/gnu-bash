# The buildin FreeBSD bash on OSX is both outdated and incompatible with the
# modern GNU bash, so for the sake of being cross-platform friendly this
# manifest provides GNU bash.
# NOTE: This is the 5.1-rc1 version, which is almost the same as what Homebrew
# uses (Homebrew installs 5.0 with the 18 patches that in fact make the 5.1-rc1
# version).
