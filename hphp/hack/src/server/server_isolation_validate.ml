(** Whether [error] is a reason the candidate could not be this package.

    Any error that refers to the candidate counts, whatever its code:
    enumerating the package error codes instead would answer "isolatable" for
    any way of breaking a package we had not thought to list.

    Warnings do not count. The repository typechecks clean, which is what lets
    an error be attributed to the synthesized package — but that holds for the
    errors the repository is configured to see, and the filter used here turns
    on every warning besides. Those fire on code that was already there:
    "this null coalesce will always evaluate to its left-hand side" is a fair
    remark about a candidate's file and no reason it cannot be a package.

    Referring to the candidate means some reason inside it: a diagnostic's
    reasons sit at what is referred to, so this is what distinguishes a
    reference into the candidate from a checked file's own unrelated complaint.
    The claim may be inside or outside — outside is the reference in that a
    cluster must not have, and inside is the candidate reaching into its own
    [__tests__], which strict isolation no longer exempts. Both disqualify it. *)

    never takes the file and the answer would be about a candidate missing it.
    Reported like an unknown path rather than worked around: the cluster asked
    about is not one this command can construct.
