(* This module tracks changes to mergebase, and is also informed (by functions below)
 * about the sizes of jobs that are being processed. If we are in "mergebase changed"
 * state AND a big job have occurred, it can infer that this job was DUE to rebase,
 * and that restarting will be faster than going forward (due to possibility of better
 * saved state being available, or possibility to treat some files as prechecked
 * (see ServerPrecheckedFiles.ml).
 *
 * If there is no better saved state available and the only reason we restart is due
 * to handling of prechecked files, we could theoretically avoid the restart.
 * But initialization and incremental mode are so divergent that this would require
 * implementing entire thing twice (and was not done - we can only treat files
 * as prechecked during init).
 *
 * Moreover:
 *
 * - attributing incremental file changes to rebases is based on timing and
 *   there is a risk that we would precheck a real local change
 * - even if we just want to treat files as prechecked, without fully processing
 *   them, it can require quiet a lot of work in incrmental mode to invalidate all
 *   things that need to be invalidated (which are absent during init)
