# HipHop VM for PHP

HipHop VM (HHVM) is a new open-source virtual machine designed for executing programs written in PHP. HHVM uses a just-in-time compilation approach to achieve superior performance while maintaining the flexibility that PHP developers are accustomed to. HipHop VM (and before it HPHPc) has realized > 5x increase in throughput for Facebook compared with Zend PHP 5.2.

HipHop is most commonly run as a standalone server, replacing both Apache and modphp.

## Installing

You can install a [prebuilt package](https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wiki#installing-pre-built-packages-for-hhvm) or [compile from source](https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wiki#building-hhvm).

## Running

You can run standalone programs just by passing them to hhvm: `hhvm my_script.php`.

HipHop bundles in a webserver. So if you want to run on port 80 with document root `/var/www`:

```
sudo hhvm -m server /var/www
```

For anything more complicated, you'll want to make a [`config.hdf`](https://github.com/facebook/hiphop-php/wiki/Runtime-options#server) and run `sudo hhvm -m server -c config.hdf`.
