      - Could happen if the editor writes files in a certain way, such as if
        they delete the file before moving a new one into place.
      - Could happen if the language server was not able to read the file,
        despite it existing on disk (e.g. due to permissions). In this case,
        we would fail to generate its [FileInfo.t] and assume that it was
        deleted. This is correct from a certain point of view.
      - Could happen due to a benign race condition where we process
        file-change notifications more slowly than they happen. If a file is
        quickly created, then deleted before we process the create event,
        we'll think it was deleted twice. This is the correct way to handle
        the race condition.
