Sketchy condition: a value of type Traversable<int> may be truthy even when empty.
Hack collections and arrays are falsy when empty, but user-defined Traversables will always be truthy, even when empty.
If you would like to only allow containers which are falsy when empty, use the `Container` or `KeyedContainer` interfaces. (Lint[5623])
