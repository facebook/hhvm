  (* There are some pathological scenarios concerned with high volumes of requests.
     1. There's a finite unix pipe between monitor and server, used for handoff. When
     that pipe gets full (~30 requests), the monitor will freeze for 4s before closing
     the client request.
     2. In ClientConnect.connect we allow the monitor only 1s to respond before we
     abandon our connection attempt and try again, repeated up to --timeout times (by
     default infinite). If the monitor takes >1s to work through its queue, then every
     item placed there will be expired before the monitor gets to handle it, and we'll
     never recover.
     3. The monitor's finite incoming queue will become full too, disallowing clients from
     even connecting.
     4. Aside from those concerns, just practically, the commonest mode of failure I've observed
     is that the monitor actually just gets stuck -- sometimes stuck on a "read" call to
     read requests parameters where it should make progress or get an EOF but just sits there
     indefinitely, sometimes stuck on a "select" call to see if there's a request on the queue
     where I know there are outstanding requests but again it doesn't see them. I have no
     explanation for these phemona. *)
