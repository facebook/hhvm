(* Mapping from local variables to their mutability
  Local mutability is stored in the local environment.
  Mutability flavor of the local is determined on the first assignment.
  - Borrowed/maybemutable locals cannot be reassigned because it will create
    an alias for the value
  - immutable locals can be reassigned because they
    don't have single-reference restriction
  - owned mutable locals can be reassigned because rhs is always something that
    transfers the ownership of the value (Rx\mutable or Rx\move) so
    single-reference restriction will still be preserved
  - for locals - arguments to move\freeze calls we still keep value in map
    as MutableUnset to keep mutability flavor information
