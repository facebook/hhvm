Capturing two snapshots...
resource(%d) of type (HeapGraphContext)
resource(%d) of type (HeapGraphContext)
Stats for first capture:
array(3) {
  ["nodes"]=>
  int(%d)
  ["edges"]=>
  int(%d)
  ["roots"]=>
  int(%d)
}
Getting invalid nodes and edges:
Invalid nodes and edges work OK.

Traversing second capture:

RootClass

Traversing first capture:
ChildWithClosureMember

RootClass

Traversing edges for first capture:
Property:child
Property:children
Property:closure
Property:somestring

Traversing roots for first capture:

Getting in edges of root class:
