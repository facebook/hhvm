/**
 * Major departures from Zend:
 *
 * 1. We are only supporting UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 encoding.
 *    Major reason for this is because the original get_next_char() bothers me,
 *    sacrificing performance for some character sets that people rarely used
 *    or that people shouldn't use. UTF-8 should really be the standard string
 *    format everywhere, and we ought to write coding specifilized for it to
 *    take full advantage of it: one example would be the new html encoding
 *    function that simply do *p one a time iterating through the strings to
 *    look for special characters for entity escaping.
 *
 * 2. HTML encoding function no longer encodes entities other than the basic
 *    ones. There is no need to encode them, since all browsers support UTF-8
 *    natively, and we are ok to send out UTF-8 encoding characters without
 *    turning them into printable ASCIIs. Basic entities are encoded for
 *    a different reason! In fact, I personally don't see why HTML spec has
 *    those extended list of entities, other than historical artifacts.
 *
 * 3. Double encoding parameter is not supported. That really sounds like
 *    a workaround of buggy coding. I don't find a legit use for that yet.
