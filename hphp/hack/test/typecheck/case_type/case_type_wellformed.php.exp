Illegal usage of a covariant type parameter (Typing[4120])
  File "case_type_wellformed.php", line 6, characters 48-51:
  This is where the parameter was declared as covariant `+`

  This position is contravariant (-) because it is the composition of (-)(+)
The rest of the error messages decomposes the inference of the variance.
