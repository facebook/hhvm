# 0. BUILDING AND INSTALLATION (Briefly)

## Autoconf

     $ ./configure
     $ make
     $ make verify   # (optional)
     $ sudo make install

## Cmake (General)


The following Libevent specific Cmake variables are as follows (the values being
the default).

```
# Installation directory for executables
EVENT_INSTALL_BIN_DIR:PATH=bin

# Installation directory for CMake files
EVENT_INSTALL_CMAKE_DIR:PATH=lib/cmake/libevent

## Installation directory for header files
EVENT_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=include

## Installation directory for libraries
EVENT_INSTALL_LIB_DIR:PATH=lib

## Define if libevent should be built with shared libraries instead of archives
EVENT__BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARIES:BOOL=OFF

# Enable running gcov to get a test coverage report (only works with
# GCC/CLang). Make sure to enable -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug as well.
EVENT__COVERAGE:BOOL=OFF

# Defines if libevent should build without the benchmark exectuables
EVENT__DISABLE_BENCHMARK:BOOL=OFF

# Define if libevent should build without support for a debug mode
EVENT__DISABLE_DEBUG_MODE:BOOL=OFF

# Define if libevent should not allow replacing the mm functions
EVENT__DISABLE_MM_REPLACEMENT:BOOL=OFF

# Define if libevent should build without support for OpenSSL encrpytion
EVENT__DISABLE_OPENSSL:BOOL=OFF

# Disable the regress tests
EVENT__DISABLE_REGRESS:BOOL=OFF

# Disable sample files
EVENT__DISABLE_SAMPLES:BOOL=OFF

# If tests should be compiled or not
EVENT__DISABLE_TESTS:BOOL=OFF

# Define if libevent should not be compiled with thread support
EVENT__DISABLE_THREAD_SUPPORT:BOOL=OFF

# Enables verbose debugging
EVENT__ENABLE_VERBOSE_DEBUG:BOOL=OFF

# When crosscompiling forces running a test program that verifies that Kqueue
# works with pipes. Note that this requires you to manually run the test program
# on the the cross compilation target to verify that it works. See cmake
# documentation for try_run for more details
EVENT__FORCE_KQUEUE_CHECK:BOOL=OFF

# set EVENT_STAGE_VERSION
EVENT__STAGE_VERSION:STRING=beta
```

__More variables can be found by running `cmake -LAH <sourcedir_path>`__


## CMake (Windows)

Install CMake: <http://www.cmake.org>


     $ md build && cd build
     $ cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ..   # Or whatever generator you want to use cmake --help for a list.
     $ start libevent.sln

## CMake (Unix)

     $ mkdir build && cd build
     $ cmake ..     # Default to Unix Makefiles.
     $ make
     $ make verify  # (optional)


# 1. BUILDING AND INSTALLATION (In Depth)

## Autoconf

To build libevent, type

     $ ./configure && make


 (If you got libevent from the git repository, you will
  first need to run the included "autogen.sh" script in order to
  generate the configure script.)

You can run the regression tests by running

     $ make verify

Install as root via

     $ make install

Before reporting any problems, please run the regression tests.

To enable the low-level tracing build the library as:

     $ CFLAGS=-DUSE_DEBUG ./configure [...]

Standard configure flags should work.  In particular, see:

   --disable-shared          Only build static libraries
   --prefix                  Install all files relative to this directory.


The configure script also supports the following flags:

   --enable-gcc-warnings     Enable extra compiler checking with GCC.
   --disable-malloc-replacement
                             Don't let applications replace our memory
                             management functions
   --disable-openssl         Disable support for OpenSSL encryption.
   --disable-thread-support  Don't support multithreaded environments.

## CMake (Windows)

(Note that autoconf is currently the most mature and supported build
enviroment for libevent; the cmake instructions here are new and
experimental, though they _should_ be solid.  We hope that cmake will
still be supported in future versions of Libevent, and will try to
make sure that happens.)

First of all install <http://www.cmake.org>.

To build libevent using Microsoft Visual studio open the "Visual Studio Command prompt" and type:

```
$ cd <libevent source dir>
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -G "Visual Studio 10" ..   # Or whatever generator you want to use cmake --help for a list.
$ start libevent.sln
```

In the above, the ".." refers to the dir containing the Libevent source code. 
You can build multiple versions (with different compile time settings) from the same source tree
by creating other build directories. 

It is highly recommended to build "out of source" when using
CMake instead of "in source" like the normal behaviour of autoconf for this reason.

The "NMake Makefiles" CMake generator can be used to build entirely via the command line.

To get a list of settings available for the project you can type:

```
$ cmake -LH ..
```

### GUI

CMake also provides a GUI that lets you specify the source directory and output (binary) directory
that the build should be placed in.

### OpenSSL support

To build Libevent with OpenSSL support you will need to have OpenSSL binaries available when building,
these can be found here: <http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html>

# 2. USEFUL LINKS:

For the latest released version of Libevent, see the official website at
<http://libevent.org/> .

There's a pretty good work-in-progress manual up at
   <http://www.wangafu.net/~nickm/libevent-book/> .

For the latest development versions of Libevent, access our Git repository
via

```
$ git clone https://github.com/libevent/libevent.git
```

You can browse the git repository online at:

<https://github.com/libevent/Libevent>

To report bugs, issues, or ask for new features:

__Patches__: https://github.com/libevent/libevent/pulls
> OK, those are not really _patches_ You fork, modify, and hit the "Create Pull Request" button.
> You can still submit normal git patchs via the mailing list.

__Bugs, Features [RFC], and Issus__: https://github.com/libevent/libevent/issues
> Or you can do it via the mailing list.

There's also a libevent-users mailing list for talking about Libevent
use and development:
