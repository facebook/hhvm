## Deprecated, Unmaintained

This repo contains the Hack Language Specification, a modified version
of the PHP specification. It is no longer maintained and does not
reflect the current version of Hack.

# Hack Language Specification

The easiest way to navigate the specification is
via the [table of contents](https://github.com/hhvm/hack-langspec/blob/master/spec/00-specification-for-hack.md).

The latest official release of the specification is [1.1](https://github.com/hhvm/hack-langspec/releases/tag/v1.1).

You can run the specification tests with [HHVM](https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/) via its
[test runner](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm/blob/master/hphp/test/README.md) and the
[Hack typechecker](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/typechecker/introduction) via `hh_client`.

Pull requests, issue filings and comments are extremely welcome.
