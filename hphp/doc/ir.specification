* HipHop Intermediate Representation (HHIR)
*******************************************



Introduction
------------

The HipHop Intermediate Representation (IR) is a typed, in-memory,
static-single-assignment, intermediate-level representation of HHBC programs
used for just in time compilation, with these goals:

  1. Complete. The IR represents a program or program fragment entirely,
     without reference to HHBC or other upstream forms of the program.

  2. Type-Safe. Since the IR deals directly with refined types and internal VM
     types, all operations are typesafe. All instruction parameters have a
     parameter type P, and all variables have a type S. Given an instruction
     with source parameter type P and variable type S, S must be equal to or
     more refined than P (S == P or S <: P).

  3. Machine Independent. Since this IR is intended to be used in a JIT
     compiler, it will always be used in a machine specific context.
     Nevertheless, we rely on machine independence in order to separate
     concerns and increase portability of the VM. Passes which manipulate IR
     based on PHP or HHBC semantics should be portable. Passes which deal with
     machine specifics (such as register allocation) should be done in the
     lower level IR (vasm). Types are machine independent.

The unit of compilation is the IRUnit, which is a collection of Blocks
containing IRInstructions that produce and consume SSATmp values. Blocks are
single-entry, single-exit sequences of instructions (i.e. basic
blocks). Instructions may be annotated with Type parameter which modifies the
instruction's behavior, or with additional compile-time constant data (see
extra-data.h). Each SSATmp has a Type which describes the set of values it may
hold, over its entire live range. Instructions may have side effects, which
occur in execution order.

The static single assignment form guarantees the following two invariants for a
well-formed compilation unit:

  1. Each SSATmp is assigned to by exactly one IRInstruction.

  2. Definitions dominate uses. Every path to an IRInstruction using an SSATmp
     first executes the IRInstruction defining the SSATmp.

Any pass that generates or manipulates IR must preserve these invariants,
however it is possible and expected for the invariants to be temporarily broken
during IR generation or during an optimization pass.


Control Flow
------------

IRUnits have one entry block, zero or more exit blocks, and zero or more catch
blocks. Exit blocks leave the compilation unit in the middle of the same PHP
function using one of several instructions that exit a compilation unit
(e.g. ReqBindJmp). Catch blocks are blocks that are reachable from exceptional
control flow edges, and are executed during unwinding if an exception
propagates through the instruction that had it as a `taken' edge.

No SSATmps are defined on entry to the main Block.

Blocks which are join points may start with a DefLabel with destination
SSATmps. In that case, each predecessor must be a Jmp passing a matching number
of sources. In this case the Jmp acts as a tail-call, passing arguments the
same way a plain call would.

Together, the sources of the Jmp instructions and the destinations of the
DefLabel instructions act as traditional SSA Phi pseudo-functions; The type of
the DefLabel's destination is the type-union of the corresponding sources.
Because the Jmp sources are at the ends of blocks, they do not violate the SSA
dominator rule (rule 2, above).


Types
-----

For an overview of the HHIR type system, see the "Type System" section in
hackers-guide/jit-core.md.


SSATmps
-------

An SSATmp represents a virtual register. Since HHIR uses SSA, an SSATmp may
only be assigned to by one instruction. The type of an SSATmp represents the
set of values it may hold at the point it is defined, which is invariant over
the lifetime of the variable (from the definition point to the last use).


IRInstructions
--------------

An instruction is an executable operation with zero or more inputs (sources),
zero or one result (destination), and possible side effects such as accessing
memory, doing I/O, and which may branch or throw an exception. Some
instructions have a Type parameter which modifies its behavior, or other "extra
data" in an arbitrary C++ struct (see extra-data.h).

Each instruction has a signature which describes its effect, parameter types,
and return type, for example:

  r:Bool = IsType<T> s:Gen

By convention we use infix; destinations on the left, = represents assignment,
then the opcode name, and source parameters. Types are to the right of the
entities they modify, separated by : for results, sources, and variables, or
delimited by <> for instruction modifiers.

Instruction flags further describe their behavior:

HasDest
NaryDest

  The instruction defines exactly one destination variable (HasDest) or a
  varying number of destination variables (NaryDest). These flags are mutually
  exclusive. An instruction with neither of these flags set has zero
  destination variables.

  Note that an instruction's destination variable may sometimes be a copy of
  one of the input variables. (For example, AddElem returns the array it took
  as an input.)

CallsNative

  Indicates that the instruction will call a native helper.

  The register allocator uses this to optimize register spills around native
  calls and to bias register allocation toward arguments and return values.

ConsumesRC

  The instruction consumes a reference to one or more of its sources, either by
  decreasing its refcount or storing the reference to memory.

ProducesRC

  The instruction produces a value with an unconsumed reference that must be
  consumed, either by DecRefing it or storing it somewhere in memory.

MayRaiseError

  The instruction may raise an error, and must have an edge to a catch block.

Terminal

  The instruction has no next instruction; it either jumps, returns, or throws.

Branch

  The instruction has a (sometimes optional) taken edge. Instructions that are
  conditional branches (i.e. a Branch that is not Terminal) will also have a
  next edge.

Passthrough

  The value of the instruction's dest is the same as one of its inputs; it
  differs only in the refcount of the underlying object, the type of the
  variable, or some other property that doesn't affect the value of the
  variable itself.

MInstrProp

  The instruction may affect the type and/or value of its base operand,
  operating on object properties.

MInstrElem

  The instruction may affect the type and/or value of its base operand,
  operating on array elements.


Instruction set
---------------

1. Checks and Asserts

Note: Instructions that check boxed types only check that the operand is boxed,
and they ignore the type of the value inside the box (the inner type). The
inner type is normally checked when the value within the box is about to be
loaded, using a separate CheckRefInner instruction.

| CheckType<T>, DRefineS(0), S(Gen,Cls), B|P

  Check that the type of the src S0 is T, and if so copy it to D, and
  fallthrough. If S0 cannot be proven to be T, branch to block B. Note that
  this means S0 still /may/ be a subtype of T in block B in some circumstances.

  Specifically, subtypes of Type::Static may not be checked precisely,
  depending on the type of the source.  This means the instruction may take the
  branch in some circumstances even when S0 is a subtype of T, if T has a
  non-empty intersection with Type::Static.

  Also note that many types are not supported as the typeParam right now.

| CheckNullptr, ND, S(CountedStr,Nullptr), B|CRc

  If S0 is not a null pointer, branch to block B. This is used to check the
  return value of a native helper that returns a potentially null StringData*.

| AssertType, DRefineS(0), S(Gen,Cls,Ctx), P

  Assert that the type of S0 is T, copying it to D.

| CheckTypeMem<T>, ND, S(PtrToGen), B

  If the value pointed to by S0 is not type T, branch to the block B.

| HintLocInner<T,localId>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Hint that the inner type of a BoxedCell in localId is likely type T, where T
  is a subtype of BoxedCell. The type must be guarded on before it is known to
  be true (via LdRef).

| HintStkInner<T,offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  Hint that the inner type of the BoxedInitCell on the stack pointed to by S0
  at offset (in cells) is T. The type must be guarded on before it is known to
  be true (via LdRef).

| CheckLoc<T,localId>, ND, S(FramePtr), B

  Check that type of the given localId on the frame S0 is T; if not, branch to
  block B.

| CheckStk<T,offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), B

  Check that the type of the cell on the stack pointed to by S0 at offset (in
  cells) is T; if not, branch to block B.

| AssertLoc<T,localId>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Asserts that type of the supplied local on the frame S0 is T. This is used
  for local type information, and is similar to CheckLoc except it doesn't
  imply a runtime check (the assertion must've already been proven to be true)
  and cannot cause control flow.

  Returns a new frame pointer representing the same frame as S0 but with the
  knowledge that the asserted local has type T.

| AssertStk<T,offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  Assert that stack element at `offset' (in cells) from S0 has type T. This is
  similar to a CheckStk except that it does not imply a runtime check and
  cannot cause control flow.

| CastStk<T,offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), Er

  Cast the stack element at `offset' (in cells) from S0 to type T.

| CastMem<T>, ND, S(PtrToGen), Er

  Cast the TypedValue at S0 to type T.

The following instructions deal with parameter coercion (the standard type
conversion for arguments to HNI functions). If parameter coercion fails these
functions will throw a TVCoercion exception. They may throw other types of
exceptions depending on how coercion is implemented.

| CoerceStk<T,offset,fn,argNum>, ND, S(StkPtr), Er

  Converts the stack slot at offset (in cells) to type T, with the semantics
  needed for calling a builtin function. May throw a TVCoercionException in the
  case of failed parameter coercion. The callee is f, and the position of the
  argument being coerced is argNum.

| CoerceMem<T,fn,argNum>, ND, S(PtrToGen), Er

  Coerces the TypedValue at S0 to type T, with the semantics
  needed for calling a builtin function. May throw a TVCoercionException in the
  case of failed parameter coercion. The callee is fn, and the position of the
  argument being coerced is argNum.

| CoerceCellToBool<fn,argNum>, D(Bool), S(Cell), Er

| CoerceCellToInt<fn,argNum>,  D(Int), S(Cell), Er

| CoerceStrToInt<fn,argNum>,   D(Int), S(Str), Er

| CoerceCellToDbl<fn,argNum>,  D(Dbl), S(Cell), Er

| CoerceStrToDbl<fn,argNum>,   D(Dbl), S(Str), Er

  These instructions convert either a Cell or a Str to a primitive type (Bool,
  Int, Dbl) and return the resulting value. They may throw an exception upon
  failed type coercion. They are encoded along with callee Func, fn, and the
  integer position of the argument, argNum, being coerced.

| CheckInit, ND, S(Gen), B

  If S0's type is Uninit, branch to block B.

| CheckInitMem, ND, S(PtrToGen), B

  If the value pointed to by S0 has type Uninit, branch to block B.

| CheckCold<TransID>, ND, NA, B

  Check if the counter associated with translation TransID is cold (i.e. within
  a fixed threshold). If it's not (i.e. such translation has reached the
  "hotness threshold"), then branch to block B.

| CheckRefs, ND, S(Func) S(Int) C(Int) S(Int) S(Int), B

  Perform reffiness guard checks. Operands:

    S0 - function pointer for the frame
    S1 - num params expected in the func
    S2 - first bit to check, must be a multiple of 64
    S3 - mask to check (RefDeps::Record::m_mask entries)
    S4 - values to check (RefDeps::Record::m_vals entries)

  If any of the checks fail, branch to block B.

| EndGuards, ND, NA, NF

  A no-op at runtime, this instruction serves to mark the end of the initial
  sequence of guards in a trace.

| CheckNonNull, DSubtract(0, Nullptr), S(Nullptr,Func,PtrToGen,TCA,Cls), B

  If the value in S0 is Nullptr, branch to block B.

| AssertNonNull, DSubtract(0, Nullptr), S(Nullptr,CountedStr,Func), P

  Returns S0, with Nullptr removed from its type. This instruction currently
  supports a very limited range of types but can be expanded if needed.

| CheckClosureStaticLocInit, ND, S(BoxedCell), B

  Check if the closure static local represented by S0 is initialized, and if
  not branch to block B.

2. Arithmetic

| XorInt, D(Int), S(Int) S(Int), NF

| Shl, D(Int), S(Int) S(Int), NF

| Shr, D(Int), S(Int) S(Int), NF

  Double arithmetic, integer arithmetic, and integer bitwise operations.
  Performs the operation described by the opcode name on S0 and S1, and puts
  the result in D.

  Undefined behavior occurs if Mod is given a divisor of zero, or if the
  divisor is -1 and the dividend is the minimum representable integer.

  AbsDbl computes the absolute value of a double-precision value.

  DivDbl conforms to IEEE 754. In particular, division by zero returns +/- INF
  or NAN depending on the dividend; and should the result of a division be zero
  the sign will follow the normal sign rules for division.

  DivInt will perform integer division of S1 by S0. S0 should not be zero and
  must divide S1.

  Note that Shr is an arithmetic right shift: The MSB is sign-extended.

  Floor and Ceil will return an integral value not greater, or not less
  than their input respectively. Their use requires SSE 4.1, availability
  should be checked before they are emitted.

  AddIntO, SubIntO, MulIntO perform integer arithmetic on S0 and S1, but will
  branch to block B on integer overflow.

| XorBool, D(Bool), S(Bool) S(Bool), NF

  Logical XOR of the two sources. (Note that && and || do not have
  corresponding opcodes because they're handled at the bytecode level, to
  implement short-circuiting.)

| Mod, D(Int), S(Int) S(Int), NF

  Compute S0 mod S1. If S1 is -1 or 0 the results are undefined.

| InstanceOf, D(Bool), S(Cls) S(Cls|Nullptr), NF

  Sets D based on whether S0 is a descendant of the class, interface, or trait
  in S1. (Note that this is always false for a trait). S1 may be null at
  runtime if the class is not defined.

| InstanceOfIface, D(Bool), S(Cls) CStr, NF

  Fast path for interface checks. Sets D based on whether S0 implements S1, but
  S1 must be a unique interface. This should only be used in repo-authoritative
  mode.

| InstanceOfIfaceVtable<iface>, D(Bool), S(Cls), NF

  Faster path for interface checks. Sets D based on whether S0 implements
  iface, which must be a unique interface with an assigned vtable slot.

| ExtendsClass<cls,strictLikely>, D(Bool), S(Cls), NF

  A fast-path for instanceof checks. Sets D based on whether S0 is a descendant
  of cls, where cls must be a unique class that is not an interface or a trait.

  If strictLikely is true, optimize for the case where S0 is not equal to S1.

| InstanceOfBitmask,           D(Bool), S(Cls) CStr,                      NF

| NInstanceOfBitmask,          D(Bool), S(Cls) CStr,                      NF

  specialized type.

| IsNType<T>, D(Bool), S(Cell), NF

  specialized type.

| IsTypeMem<T>, D(Bool), S(PtrToGen), NF

  specialized type.

  The value in S0 must not be a pointer into the evaluation stack or frame
  locals.

| IsNTypeMem<T>, D(Bool), S(PtrToGen), NF

5. Branches

| JmpZero,                          ND, S(Int,Bool),                     B

| JmpNZero,                         ND, S(Int,Bool),                     B

  Conditionally jump to based on S0.

| JmpSSwitchDest, ND, S(TCA) S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), T

  Jump to the target of a sswitch statement, leaving the region, where the
  target TCA is S0.

| JmpSwitchDest, ND, S(Int) S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), T

  Jump to the target of a switch statement, leaving the region, using table
  metadata <JmpSwitchData> and index S0, which must be a valid index in the
  jump table.

| ProfileSwitchDest<handle,nCases>, ND, S(Int), NF

  Profile a switch statement target.

| CheckSurpriseFlags, ND, S(FramePtr,StkPtr), B

  Tests the implementation-specific surprise flags. If they're true, branches
  to block B. This is done by comparing an evaluation stack pointer to the RDS
  stackLimitAndSurprise word. Note that in a resumed, the frame pointer is not
  pointing into the eval stack, so S0 should be a StkPtr in that case.

| ReturnHook, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Gen), Er

  Surprise flag hook for function returns.

| SuspendHookE, ND, S(FramePtr) S(FramePtr) S(Obj), Er

  Surprise flag hook for suspending eagerly executing async functions or
  generators.  Decrefs S2 if it throws an exception.

| SuspendHookR, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Obj|Nullptr), Er

  Surprise flag hook for suspending resumed async functions or generators.  For
  generators, the second parameter should be Nullptr.

| Halt, ND, NA, T

  Halt execution. Used only in tests or unreachable code.

| Jmp, ND, SVar(Top), B|T

  Unconditional jump to block B. In the second form, the target block must
  start with a DefLabel with the same number of destinations as Jmp's number of
  sources. Jmp parallel-copies its sources to the DefLabel destinations.

| DefLabel, DMulti, NA, NF

  DefLabel defines variables received from a previous Jmp. A DefLabel with zero
  destinations is a no-op, and the predecessor blocks may not necessarily end
  in Jmp. A DefLabel with one or more destinations may only be reached by a Jmp
  instruction with the same number of sources. Ordinary branch instructions may
  not pass values to a DefLabel.


6. Reference manipulation

| Box, D(BoxedInitCell), S(Cell), CRc|PRc

  Box S0 and put the resulting BoxedInitCell in D. If S0 is Uninit, then
  InitNull will be boxed instead.

| UnboxPtr, DUnboxPtr, S(PtrToGen), NF

  If S0 points to a cell that is KindOfRef, dereference the pointer in the
  TypedValue and return a pointer to the inner-cell in D.

| BoxPtr, DBoxPtr, S(PtrToGen), NF

  Boxes the TypeValue that S0 points to if it is not boxed. The result D points
  to the same TypedValue as S0 but has a more refined type.

  S0 may not already point into a RefData (due to VM invariants), although the
  IR type system does not enforce it.


7. Loads

| LdStk<T,offset>, DParamMayRelax, S(StkPtr), NF

  Loads from S0 at offset (in cells), and puts the value in D as type T.

| LdLoc<T,localId>, DParamMayRelax, S(FramePtr), NF

  Loads local slot localId from the frame S0 and puts the value in D as type T.

| LdLocPseudoMain<T,localId>, DParam, S(FramePtr), B

  Loads local number localId from frame S0 and puts the value in D if the
  local's type is a subtype of T. If the local's type is not a subtype of T,
  then the load does not happen, and this instruction branches to B. This
  instruction is used for loading locals in pseudo-mains, where they can alias
  globals.

| LdStkAddr<T,offset>, D(PtrToStkGen), S(StkPtr), NF

  Loads the address of the stack slot given by the pointer in S0 at the offset
  (in cells). T must be a subtype of PtrToStkGen.

| LdLocAddr<localId>, D(PtrToFrameGen), S(FramePtr), NF

  Loads the address of the local slot localId from the frame S0 into D.

| LdRDSAddr<T,RDSHandle>, DParam, NA, NF

  Load the address of a Gen that lives at the specified RDS handle. The type
  param must be a subtype of PtrToGen.

| LdVectorBase, D(PtrToMembCell), S(Obj), NF

| LdPairBase, D(PtrToMembCell), S(Obj), NF

  Loads the base pointer to an array of Cells from the given collection
  instance in S0.

| LdMem<T>, DParam, S(PtrToGen), NF

  Loads from S0 and puts the value in D.

| LdContField<T>, DParam, S(Obj) C(Int), NF

  Loads a property from the object referenced by S0 at the offset given by S1
  and puts the value in D. S0 must be a Generator.

| LdElem, D(Cell), S(PtrToCell) S(Int), NF

  Loads the element at index S1 from the base pointer in S0. The index in S1 is
  the number of bytes from the base in S0.

| LdColArray, D(Arr), S(Obj), NF

  Load the array backing a collection instance in S0, which must be a Vector,
  Map, Set, ImmVector, ImmMap, or ImmSet, and that specific object type must be
  known at compile time.

| CheckRefInner<T>, ND, S(BoxedCell), B

  TODO(#2939547): this should take BoxedInitCell

  Check that the inner type of the boxed cell in S0 is T, and if not take the
  branch to B.

| LdRef<T>, DParam, S(BoxedCell), NF

  TODO(#2939547): this should take BoxedInitCell

  Loads the value held in the box referenced by S0 and puts the value in D. The
  inner type of S0 must be a subtype of T (usually ensured with a previous
  CheckRefInner).

| LdCtx, DCtx, S(FramePtr), NF

  Loads into D the value of the m_this/m_cls field out of the frame pointer S0,
  which must be a frame for the function in the LdCtx's marker. The result
  could be either an object representing the this pointer or a class context.

| LdCctx, D(Cctx), S(FramePtr), NF

  Loads into D the value of the m_cls field out of the frame pointer S0. The
  compiler should generate this only if it can prove that the frame does not
  contain a nullptr or $this pointer.

| LdClosure<T>, DParam, S(FramePtr), NF

  Loads into D the value of the m_this/m_cls field out of the frame pointer S0.
  The compiler should generate this only if it can prove that the frame context
  is a closure object of type T.  Unlike LdCtx and LdCctx, there are no special
  rules about the relative positions of LdClosure and InitCtx instructions.

| CheckCtxThis, ND, S(Ctx), B

  Check that the context (m_this or m_cls) in S0 is a non-null $this
  pointer. If not, branch to B.

| CastCtxThis, DThis, S(Ctx), P

  Convert a Ctx known to contain a $this pointer to a specific object type,
  based on the marker func for this instruction.

| LdClsCtx, D(Cls), S(Ctx), NF

  Loads into D the class representing the current context. Extracts the class
  from S0, which can be either the this pointer or the context class.

| LdClsCctx, D(Cls), S(Cctx), NF

  Loads into D the class representing the current context. Extracts the class
  from the S0, which is a context class.

| LdClsCtor, D(Func), S(Cls) S(FramePtr), Er

  Loads into D the constructor of class S0. If the constructor cannot be called
  from the context in S1, raise an error.

| DefConst<T>, DParam, NA, NF

  Define a constant value of type T. D is presumed to be globally available and
  the DefConst instruction will not actually appear in the IR instruction
  stream.

| Conjure<T>, DParam, NA, NF

  Define a value of type T. This instruction aborts at runtime; it is meant to
  be used in tests or code that is known to be unreachable.

| ConjureUse, ND, S(Gen), NF

  Define a "use" of S0 effectively keeping the value alive. As with Conjure it
  should not appear in reachable code.

| LdCls, D(Cls), S(Str) C(Cls), Er

  Loads the class named S0 in the context of the class S1. Invokes autoload and
  may raise an error if the class is not defined. The explicit context
  parameter allows the compiler to simplify this instruction to a DefConst in
  some cases. If S0 is constant, this instruction may be simplified to a
  LdClsCached.

| LdClsCached, D(Cls), CStr, Er

  Loads the class named S0 via the RDS. Invokes autoload and may raise an error
  if the class is not defined.

| LdClsCachedSafe, D(Cls), CStr, B

  Loads the class whose name is S0 out of the RDS. If the class is not defined,
  branch to B.

| LdClsInitData, D(PtrToClsInitCell), S(Cls), NF

  Loads the pointer to the property initializer array for class S0.

| LookupClsRDS, D(Cls|Nullptr), S(Str), NF

  Lookup the cached-class RDS handle for a given class name. Dereference that
  handle and return the associated Class, or null if not present.

| LdCns, DCns, CStr, B|PRc

  Load the constant named S0, branching to B if isn't present.

| LookupCns<T,constName>,   DCns, CStr, Er|PRc

| LookupCnsE<T,constName>,  DCns, CStr, Er|PRc

  Load a constant via the RDS. Raises an undefined constant notice if the
  constant cannot be defined.  The E variant will instead throw a fatal error if
  it cannot define the constant.  These should only be executed if LdCns on the
  same constant has failed.

| LookupCnsU<T,constName,fallbackName>, DCns, CStr CStr, Er|PRc

  Load an unqualified constant via the RDS, first by trying constName, then by
  trying fallbackName.  Raises a notice if neither can be found.  Should only
  be executed if LdCns on the same constant has failed.

| LdClsCns<className,constantName>, D(PtrToGen), NA, B

  Load the address of the constant 'constantName' for the class 'className' in
  RDS. If not initialized, branch to B.

| LdClsMethodFCacheFunc<clsName,methodName>, D(Func), NA, B

  Loads the target cache entry for a forwarding call to clsName::methodName.
  If the method does not exist, or the cache hasn't been filled yet, branch to
  B.

| LookupClsMethodFCache<clsName,methodName>,
|    D(Func|Nullptr), C(Cls) S(FramePtr),
|    Er

  Lookup clsName::methodName in the forwarding class method cache. S0 should be
  the Class named by clsName and S1 should be the current vm frame pointer. May
  return Nullptr if lookup fails using a subset of the required lookup paths,
  indicating that a more complete lookup path should be taken. May throw if the
  method does not exist.

| GetCtxFwdCallDyn<clsName,methodName>, D(Ctx), S(Ctx), PRc

  If S0 is a Cctx, return S0. If S0 is an object, check if clsName::methodName
  is a static method. If it is, return S0's class as a Ctx pointer. If not,
  return S0. If S0 is a Ctx, dynamically check if it is a non-null object
  pointer or Cctx at runtime and perform the operations described above. This
  instruction must only be used when the value is known to not be empty.

| GetCtxFwdCall, D(Ctx), S(Ctx) C(Func), PRc

  If S0 is an object and S1 is static, this opcode returns S0's class. If S0 is
  an object and S1 is not static, this opcode increfs S0 and returns it. If S0
  is a Cctx, this opcode returns S0.

| LdClsMethodCacheFunc<clsName,methodName>, D(Func), NA, B

  Loads the target cache entry for the method clsName::methodName. If the
  method does not exist or the cache hasn't been filled yet, branch to B.

| LdClsMethodCacheCls<clsName,methodName>, D(Cctx), NA, NF

  Loads the target cache class context entry for a call to clsName::methodName
  from the current context. This instruction must only be used when the value
  is known to not be empty (i.e., LdClsMethodCacheFunc must have succeeded, or
  LookupClsMethodCache returned a non-null value).

| LookupClsMethodCache<clsName,methodName>, D(Func|Nullptr),
|                                           S(FramePtr),
|                                           Er

  Lookup a function in the class method targetcache. The class name and method
  name are clsName and methodName, respectively. S0 is the current vm frame
  pointer. Returns Nullptr if the method cannot be found using a subset of the
  required lookup paths, indicating that a more complete lookup path should be
  taken. May throw if the method does not exist.

| LdIfaceMethod<vtableIdx,methodIdx>, D(Func), S(Cls), NF

  Load the Func* at methodIdx from the vtable at vtableIdx in S0.

| LdFuncVecLen, D(Int), S(Cls,Cctx), NF

  Load the funcVecLen field from S0.

| LdClsMethod, D(Func), S(Cls,Cctx) C(Int), NF

  Load a Func* off of the class method table for S0, at offset S1 (in method
  slots).

| LookupClsMethod<offset>, ND, S(Cls) S(Str) S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), Er

  Store a pointer to a class method into an activation record. S0 points to the
  class, S1 is the method name, S2 is a stack pointer that has an activation
  record to modify at `offset', and S3 is a pointer to the current frame (used
  to get the context). May throw or fatal if method is not accessible.

| LdPropAddr<T,offset>, DParamPtr(Prop), S(Obj), NF

  Load the address of the object property for S0 + `offset' (in bytes).  T must
  be a subtype of PtrToPropGen.

| LdGblAddr, D(PtrToGblGen), S(Str), B

  Loads a pointer to a global. S0 is the global's name. Branches to B if the
  global is not defined.

| LdGblAddrDef, D(PtrToGblGen), S(Str), NF

  Loads a pointer to a global. S0 is the global's name. Defines the global if
  it is not already defined.

| LdClsPropAddrOrNull, D(PtrToSPropGen|Nullptr),
|                      S(Cls) S(Str) C(Cls),
|                      Er

  Loads a pointer to a static class property. S0 points to the class, S1 is the
  property name, and S2 is the class representing the context of the code
  accessing the property. If class S0 does not have a visible and accessible
  static property named S1, then nullptr is returned.

| LdClsPropAddrOrRaise, D(PtrToSPropGen), S(Cls) S(Str) C(Cls), Er

  Loads a pointer to a static class property. S0 points to the class, S1 is the
  property name, and S2 is the class representing the context of the code
  accessing the property. If class S0 does not have a visible and accessible
  static property named S1, throw a fatal error.

| LdObjMethod<offset,methodName,fatal>, ND, S(Cls) S(StkPtr), Er

  Stores a pointer to an object's method into an activation record. S0 points
  to the object's class, S1 has the pre-live activation record at `offset'.
  Caches the mapping in the target cache. If `fatal' is true, raises a fatal if
  the class does not have an accessible method with the given name and does not
  have a __call method; otherwise (if `fatal' is false), raises a warning and
  puts func that does nothing and returns null (SystemLib::s_nullFunc) on the
  activation record.

| LdObjInvoke, D(Func), S(Cls), B

  Try to load a cached non-static __invoke Func from the Class in S0, or branch
  to block B if it is not present.

| LdArrFuncCtx<offset>, ND, S(Arr) S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), Er

  Try to load an array as a function context. This is for use translating
  FPushFunc when the callee is an array. This instruction attempts to populate
  a partially created ActRec pointed to by S1 + `offset' (in cells).

| LdArrFPushCuf<offset>, ND, S(Arr) S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), Er

| LdStrFPushCuf<offset>, ND, S(Str) S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), Er

  Try to resolve a method target for FPushCuf when the callee is an Arr or Str,
  respectively. These instructions mutate a partially created ActRec pointed to

  and the function autoloader fails to define it.

| LdFuncCached<funcName>, D(Func), NA, Er

  Loads the Func whose name is funcName from the RDS, invoking autoload if it
  not defined yet. Fatal if function autoloader fails to define it.

| LdFuncCachedU<funcName,fallbackName>, D(Func), NA, Er

  Try to load a Func named funcName from the RDS, if it isn't defined, try to
  load a Func named fallbackName. If that also isn't defined, invoke autoload.
  If this still doesn't result in a Func, raise a fatal error.

| LdFuncCachedSafe<funcName>, D(Func), NA, B

  Try to load the Func named funcName from the RDS. If the function is not
  defined, branch to B.

| LdARFuncPtr<offset>, D(Func), S(StkPtr), NF

  Loads the m_func member of an ActRec. S0 is the base address, with `offset'
  cells to the ActRec.

| LdARNumParams, D(Int), S(FramePtr), NF

  Loads the number of params from an ActRec. S0 is the address of the ActRec

| LdFuncNumParams, D(Int), S(Func), NF

8. Allocation

| AllocObj, DAllocObj, S(Cls), PRc|Er

  Allocates a new object of class S1.

| RegisterLiveObj, ND, S(Obj), NF

  When EnableObjDestructCall is on, we need to keep track of objects to be able
  to call their destructors when a request exists.  This instruction is
  conditionally emitted to implement that.

| CheckInitProps<class>, ND, NA, B

  Check if the properties for class are initialized and branches if not.

| InitProps<class>, ND, NA, Er

  Calls the property initializer function (86pinit) for class.  May throw.

| CheckInitSProps<class>, ND, NA, B

  Check if static properties for class are initialized and branches if not.

| InitSProps<class>, ND, NA, Er

  Calls the static property initializer function (86sinit) for class. May
  throw.

| DebugBacktrace, D(Arr), S(Int), PRc

  Obtain stack trace by calling the debug_backtrace() method.

| InitThrowableFileAndLine, ND, S(Obj), NF

  Initialize Throwable's file name and line number assuming the stack trace
  was already initialized and the current vmfp() is a built-in.

  Allocates an instance of class.

| InitObjProps<class>, ND, S(Obj), NF

  Initializes properties of object S0.

  Allocate a new array in mixed mode with the expected capacity S0.

| NewDictArray, D(Arr), C(Int), PRc

  Allocate a new array in dict mode with the expected capacity S0.

| NewLikeArray, D(Arr), S(Arr) C(Int), PRc

  Allocate a new array in the same mode as S0 and with expected capacity S1,
  unless S1 == 0, in which case the capacity is set to S0's size.

| AllocPackedArray<size>, DArrPacked, NA, PRc

  Allocate a new uninitialized packed array with space for size elements in it.
  The array will be initialized with values using either InitPackedArray or
  InitPackedArrayLoop.

| AllocVecArray<size>, DArrVec, NA, PRc

  Allocate a new uninitialized vector array with space for size elements in it.
  The array will be initialized with values using either InitPackedArray or
  InitPackedArrayLoop.

| InitPackedArray<index>, ND, S(Arr) S(Gen), CRc

  Store the S1 into the slot at index in array S0. This instruction assumes
  that it doesn't have to incref the value being stored. Used to initialize an
  array allocated with AllocPackedArray.

| InitPackedArrayLoop<offset,size>, ND, S(Arr) S(StkPtr), CRc

  Move `size' elements from the stack given by S1, at `offset', into the array
  S0.  Assumes that the first element on the stack is the last element in the
  array.  Used to initialize an array allocated with AllocPackedArray that was
  too big to use a series of InitPackedArray instructions.

| NewStructArray<offset,keys...>, D(Arr), S(StkPtr), PRc|CRc

  Allocate a new key/value array, given N immediate keys and taking N elements
  off the stack given by S0, at `offset'. This instruction assumes it can take
  the values from the stack without increfing them.

| NewCol<type>, DCol, NA, PRc

  Create an empty new collection of `type'.

| NewColFromArray<type>, DCol, S(Arr), PRc|CRc

  Create a collection of `type` from an array. `type` cannot be Pair. The array
  will be used to back the new collection without duplication or conversion.
  Thus it should not contain references. In addition, the array must be in
  packed mode when `type` is Vector or ImmVector, and must be in mixed mode
  otherwise. Ownership of the array is transferred from $1 to the collection,
  without manipulating the refcount.

| Clone, DofS(0), S(Obj), PRc|Er

  Allocate an object by cloning S0.


9. Call & Return

| SpillFrame<offset,numArgs,invName>,
|   ND,
|   S(StkPtr) S(Func,Nullptr) S(Ctx,Cls,Nullptr),
|   CRc

  Operands:

     S0 - caller stack pointer
     S1 - callee Func or nullptr
     S2 - object (for FPushObjMethod*), class (for FPushClsMethod*), context
          (for FPushClsMethodF), or nullptr (for FPushFunc*).

  Defines the fields for an activation record and writes them to the stack
  pointed to by S0, at `offset'.

| CufIterSpillFrame<offset,numArgs,iterId>, ND,
|                                           S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr),
|                                           NF

  Operands:

     S0 - caller stack pointer
     S1 - caller frame pointer

  Defines the fields for an activation record using data from the iterator
  iterId, and writes them to the stack pointed to by S1, at offset.

| FreeActRec, D(FramePtr), S(FramePtr), NF

  Load the saved frame pointer from the activation record pointed to by S0 into
  D.

| BeginInlining<offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  Marks the start of an inlined function whose stack resides offset cells below
  the SP. It has no effect other than to hint to optimization passes that at the
  start of the inlined function its stack is dead.

| DefInlineFP<func,retBCOff,retSPOff>, D(FramePtr),
|                                      S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr),
|                                      NF

  Defines a frame pointer for an inlined function.

  `func' is the function being inlined. `retBCOff' and `retSPOff' represent
  what the bytecode and stack offsets should be after the FCall instruction in
  ther caller.

  This instruction is primarily used to represent a frame in the IR in a way
  that allows us to eliminate it entirely. When it cannot be eliminated (or if
  it is pushed into an unlikely path) it performs callee-side responsibilities
  for setting up an activation record (i.e. setting the return ip and m_soff,
  storing the frame pointer into D).

  The caller frame pointer is passed as S1. This is used to keep track of the
  call chain of inlined functions for simplification and dead code elimination.

| InlineReturn, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Unlinks a frame constructed by DefInlineFP.

| InlineReturnNoFrame<InlineFrameStart>, ND, NA, NF

  Mark the end of an inlined function for which no DefInlineFP was required. The
  primary purpose of this instruction is to mark the result of a SpillFrame as
  dead. InlineFrameStart is the caller FP-relative offset of the start of the
  callee frame. Everything below InlineFrameStart is dead.

| CallArray<spOffset,numParams,callOff,after,destroyLocals>,
|                       D(Gen),
|                       S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr),
|                       Er

  Invoke function corresponding to the current FPI with numParams arguments,
  the last of which is an array of the remaining args. Used for FCallArray (in
  which case numParams == 1), and FCallUnpack. S0+spOffset points to the stack
  resulting after the ActRec for the function and numParams arguments have been
  pushed. CallArray pops the array off the stack, pushes the elements of the
  array as arguments, and invokes the function in the ActRec.

| SyncReturnBC<spOffset,bcOffset>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), NF

  Stores bcOffset into the frame at spOffset from S0 as the return bytecode
  address and the frame S1 as the return frame.

| Call<offset,numParams,returnOff,funcd,destroyLocals>, D(Gen),
|                                                       S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr),
|                                                       Er

  Transfer control to a callee, based on the pre-live activation record and set
  of args on the stack pointed to by S0 at `offset'. S1 is the current caller
  frame pointer. The `funcd' in the extra data is a Func* for the callee if we
  know the callee statically.

| NativeImpl<func>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(StkPtr), Er

  Execute a call to the native builtin specified by the current function. S0
  and S1 should be the current vmfp and vmsp, respectively.

| CallBuiltin<T>, DBuiltin, S(FramePtr) S(StkPtr) SVar(PtrToGen,Gen,Cls,Nullptr), Er|PRc

  Call builtin function with N arguments. S0 and S1 should be the current vmfp
  and vmsp, respectively.

  The source and destination types correspond to C++ parameter and return types
  as follows:

    C++ type            HHIR type         Position
    -----------------   ---------         --------
    bool                Bool              source, destination
    int64_t             Int               source, destination
    double              Dbl               source, destination
    const String&       PtrToStr          source
    const Array&        PtrToArr          source
    const Object&       PtrToObj          source
    const Variant&      PtrToGen          source
    Variant&            PtrToGen          source (ref param)
    String              {Str|InitNull}    destination
    Array               {Arr|InitNull}    destination
    Object              {Obj|InitNull}    destination
    Variant             {Gen-UninitNull}  destination

| RetCtrl<spOff,suspendingResumed>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr) S(Gen), T

  Ensure that S0 + `spOff' (in cells) is stored in rvmsp and that S1's saved
  frame pointer is stored in rvmfp, then return to the saved return address in
  S1.  The return value is S2, which is passed via the rret_*() registers to
  the caller.  The `suspendingResumed' flag indicates when this instruction is
  suspending a resumable rather than performing a normal function return.

| AsyncRetCtrl<spOff,suspendingResumed>, ND,
|                                        S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr) S(InitNull),
|                                        T

  Ensure that S0 + `spOff` (in cells) is stored in rvmsp and that S1 is stored
  in rvmfp.  The `suspendingResumed' flag indicates when this instruction is
  suspending a resumable rather than performing an async function return.
  Returns by leaving the TC to enterTCHelper.

  The return value is S2, which is passed via the rret_*() registers, and must
  be null---it is only used for enterTCHelper and ignored by everything else;
  resumed functions store their real return value into the Resumable object.

| AsyncRetFast<spOff,suspendingResumed>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr) S(Cell), T

  Packs retVal (S2) into registers, sync stack (S0) and calls the asyncRetCtrl
  unique stub. The stub unblocks parents of the async function (represented by
  the frame pointer S1) and determines if it's possible to resume parent
  directly (fast path).

| AsyncSwitchFast<spOff,suspendingResumed>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr) S(Cell), T

  Pass control to any pending fast resumable wait handles, bypassing the
  scheduler.  If no fast resumables are pending, behave like AsyncRetCtrl.

| LdRetVal, D(Gen), S(FramePtr), NF

  Load the return value from the already-returned-from ActRec pointed to by S0
  into the dest.  This is used by NativeImpl.  TODO(#7150575): We want to make
  NativeImpl return a TypedValue in the C++ ABI registers.

| DbgTrashRetVal, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  For debugging purposes.  Store kTVTrashJITRetVal to the return value slot on
  the activation record pointed to by S0.

| ReleaseVVAndSkip, ND, S(FramePtr), B

  Loads the VarEnv slot off the ActRec pointed to by S0. If it is null, does
  nothing. If it is an ExtraArgs, deallocates the ExtraArgs structure.
  Otherwise it frees the VarEnv and jumps to block B. This instruction may not
  occur in an inlined call.

| GenericRetDecRefs, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Does decrefs of all the current function's locals, where S0 is a pointer to
  the relevant activation record. This instruction may not occur in an inlined
  call.


10. Stores

| StMem, ND, S(PtrToGen) S(Gen), CRc

  Store S2 into the location pointed to by S0.

| StElem, ND, S(PtrToCell) S(Int) S(Cell), CRc

  Store S2 into the location given by the index S1 from base pointer S0. The
  index in S1 is the number of bytes from the base in S0.

| StLoc<localId>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Gen), CRc

  Store S1 to local number localId on the frame pointed to by S0.

| StLocPseudoMain<localId>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Gen), CRc

  Behaves just like StLoc, except the hard requirement that it is only emitted
  for pseudo-mains. We don't optimize StGbl the same way as StLoc, as we need
  intraprocedural analysis to know whether the store is truly dead.

| StLocRange<localIds>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Gen), CRc

  Store S1 to the local variables corresponding to localIds, on the frame
  pointed to by S0.

| StRef, ND, S(BoxedCell) S(Cell), CRc

  Store the value in S1 into the RefData pointed to by S0. Stores the
  RefData::m_type also.

| StStk<offset>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(StkElem), CRc

  Store S1 to the stack pointed to by S0, at a given offset (in cells).

| DbgTrashStk<offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  For debugging purposes.  Store kTVTrashJITStk to the stack slot pointed to
  by S0, at a given offset (in cells).

| DbgTrashFrame<offset>, ND, S(StkPtr), NF

  For debugging purposes.  Store kTVTrashJITFrame to kNumActRecCells stack
  slots starting at the offset (in cells), and going toward higher memory
  addresses.

| DbgTrashMem, ND, S(PtrToGen), NF

  For debugging purposes.  Store kTVTrashJITHeap to a heap slot pointed to by
  S0.


11. Trace exits

| EagerSyncVMRegs, ND, S(FramePtr) S(StkPtr), NF

  Sync the given vmfp and vmsp to their in-memory locations.

| ReqBindJmp<bcOff,transFlags>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), T

  Emit a jump to a REQ_BIND_JMP service request to the target offset bcOff.

| ReqRetranslate<transFlags>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), T

  Emit a jump to a service request that will chain to a retranslation of this
  tracelet.

  This instruction is used in exit traces for a type prediction that occurs at
  the first bytecode offset of a tracelet.

| ReqRetranslateOpt<transId,bcOff>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr), T

  Emit a service request to retranslate, with a higher optimization gear,
  translation transID, which starts at bcOff. This instruction is used in exit
  traces that trigger profile-guided optimizations.


12. Refcounting and copies

| Mov, DofS(0), S(Top), P

  Defines D as S0. May imply register-to-register moves at code generation
  time. Does not imply an incref or any other manipulation of S0.

| IncRef, ND, S(Gen), NF

  If S0 is a refcounted type, increment its refcount.

| IncRefCtx, ND, S(Ctx), NF

  If the Ctx in S0 is a $this pointer, IncRef it.

| DecRef<locId>, ND, S(Gen), CRc

  Decrease the reference count of S0 by one, and call a destructor for types
  that require it if it goes to zero.

  Note that although DecRef takes a Gen, we don't allow it to use information
  about the inner types of a BoxedCell. This is because we don't guard on the
  inner types of a BoxedCell except when doing LdRef. For any S0 that is a
  strict subtype of BoxedCell, the DecRef must just decref it as if it were a
  BoxedCell.

  The locId is just a hint to the runtime indicating which local variable is
  being DecRef'd, if any.

| DecRefNZ, ND, S(Gen), CRc

  Decrease the reference count of S0 by one, do not check if it goes to zero.
  This instruction can be used for more efficient code when it is provable that
  the reference count cannot go to zero.


13. Misc

| DefFP, D(FramePtr), NA, NF

  Creates a temporary D representing the current vm frame pointer.

| DefSP<stackOff>, D(StkPtr), S(FramePtr), NF

  Creates a temporary D representing the current vm stack pointer. S0 is a
  pointer to the current frame. The 'stackOff' is the logical offset between S0
  and the stack pointer, but in the case of generators this is not the
  physical offset at runtime.

  This instruction is used at the beginning of tracelets to represent the state
  of the stack on entry and does not emit code.

| Count, D(Int), S(Cell), Er

  Computes the number of elements in S0. The count of an array is the number of
  elements it contains, without recursing into containers in the array.
  Subtypes of Bool|Int|Dbl|Str|Res have a count of 1, subtypes of Null have a
  count of 0. The count of objects that implement the Countable interface is
  computed by returning the value of their count method. Objects that do not
  implement Countable have a count of 1.

| CountArray,      D(Int), S(Arr), NF

| CountArrayFast,  D(Int), S(Arr), NF

| CountCollection, D(Int), S(Obj), NF

  Computes the number of elements in S0 using the same definition as Count, but
  with a restriction on the input type.

  CountArray expects any array. CountArrayFast expects an array whose kind is
  not kGlobalsKind or kProxyKind. CountCollection expects a collection object.

| Nop, ND, NA, NF

  Does nothing. It's sometimes useful for the simplifier to insert one of these
  in the instruction stream.

| ExitPlaceholder, ND, NA, B

  Does nothing if executed. Semantically, this instruction carries a taken edge
  to a block that was a pure side-exit during initial IR generation.  This
  allows later passes to test conditions and create new exits from the region
  at this point in the program.

14. Runtime helpers

| VerifyParamCls, ND, S(Cls) S(Cls|Nullptr) C(Int) C(Int), Er

  Verify parameter type for classes or traits. If S0 does not extend (if S1 is
  a class) or implement (if S1 is an interface) S1, this instruction will raise
  a recoverable fatal error describing the type mismatch.

| VerifyParamCallable, ND, S(Gen) C(Int), Er

  If S0 is not callable, as defined by the php function is_callable, this
  instruction will raise a recoverable fatal error describing the type
  mismatch.

| VerifyParamFail, ND, C(Int), Er

  Assumes that parameter number S0 in the current function has failed a its
  type check. Depending on the typehint being verified and a number of runtime
  options, may coerce the parameter to the correct type or raise a recoverable
  fatal error describing the type mismatch.

| VerifyParamFailHard, ND, C(Int), Er|T

  A terminal version of VerifyParamFail, to be used when the compiler can
  statically prove that this failure will result in a fatal error rather than a
  type coercion.

| VerifyRetCallable, ND, S(Gen), Er

  Verify a return type hint.

| VerifyRetCls, ND, S(Cls) S(Cls|Nullptr) C(Int) S(Cell), Er

  Verify a return type hint.

| RaiseUndefProp, ND, S(Obj) CStr, Er

  Raise a notice for an undefined property named S1 on the class of S0.

| RaiseMissingArg<func,argc>, ND, NA, Er

  Raise a missing argument warning because only S1 arguments were passed to
  function S0.

| RaiseError, ND, S(Str), T|Er

  Raises a fatal error with the text in S0 as its message.

| RaiseWarning, ND, S(Str), Er

  Raises a warning with the text in S0 as its message.

| RaiseNotice, ND, S(Str), Er

  Raises a notice with the text in S0 as its message.

| RaiseArrayIndexNotice, ND, S(Int), Er

  Raises a notice that S0 is an undefined index for an array.

| RaiseArrayKeyNotice, ND, S(StaticStr), Er

  Raises a notice that S0 is an undefined key for an array.

| InitClosureStaticLoc, ND, S(BoxedCell) S(Cell), NF

  Assuming S0 is an uninitialized closure static local, initialize it by
  setting it to the value in S1.

| InitStaticLoc<func,staticLocalName>, D(BoxedInitCell), S(Cell), NF

  Initialize the static local variable named 'staticLocalName' for
  function 'func' with S0 and return it.

| InitClsCns<className,constName>, DCns, NA, Er|PRc

  Initialize the RDS entry for a constant for a class, invoking autoload if it
  is not defined. The initialized value is returned. This instruction may raise
  an undefined constant error if autoload cannot define the constant.

| PrintStr,  ND, S(Str),  Er|CRc

| PrintInt,  ND, S(Int),  Er|CRc

| PrintBool, ND, S(Bool), Er|CRc

  Print for various types.

| AddElemIntKey, D(Arr), S(Arr) S(Int) S(Cell), Er|CRc|PRc

  Add S2 to the array S0 for the key S1, and return the resulting array.

| AddNewElem, D(Arr), S(Arr) S(Cell), Er|CRc|PRc

  Add S1 as a new element to the array S0.  (Note: S1 must actually be a
  subtype of InitCell for array invariants, but we can't assert this yet in the
  IR because many eval stack slots are not entirely typed wrt initness right
  now.)

| ArrayAdd, D(Arr), S(Arr) S(Arr), Er|CRc|PRc

  Has the effects of the php + operator on the two source arrays.

| AKExistsArr, D(Bool), S(Arr) S(Int,Str), NF

  Has the effects of array_key_exists(S0, S1).

| AKExistsObj, D(Bool), S(Obj) S(Int,Str), Er

  Has the effects of array_key_exists(S0, S1) on an object S0. This either does
  collection accesses, or uses the ArrayAccess API.

| GetMemoKey, D(Cell), S(Cell), Er|PRc

  Given a cell, produces a cell that can be used as a cache key. Valid values
  for the input include all basic types, arrays and collections, and objects
  that implement IMemozieParam. Any other type will cause GetMemoKey to throw.

| ArrayIdx, D(Gen), S(Arr) S(Int,Str) S(Cell), NF

  Checks if S0 contains the key S1, and returns the result if found. Otherwise
  S2 is returned.

| MapIdx, D(Gen), S(Obj) S(Str) S(Cell), NF

  Checks if S0, which must be an HH\Map or an HH\ImmMap, contains the key S1,
  and returns the result if found. Otherwise S2 is returned.

| MethodExists, D(Bool), S(Cls) S(Str), NF

  Checks if the method named S1 exists on class S0.  S0 must be a normal class
  that is not abstract.

| LdBindAddr<SrcKey,spOff>, D(TCA), NA, NF

  Creates a service request to bind the given target address. Returns a TCA
  pointing either to the service request (before the service request is
  satisfied) or to the native code for the given target address (once the
  service request is satisfied).

| LdSwitchDblIndex, D(Int), S(Dbl) S(Int) S(Int), NF

| LdSwitchStrIndex, D(Int), S(Str) S(Int) S(Int), CRc

| LdSwitchObjIndex, D(Int), S(Obj) S(Int) S(Int), CRc|Er

  These instructions are used to determine the target of a switch statement
  with target range [S1:S1 + S2), when invoked with the value S0. They call
  helper functions to check whether S0 is an numeric integer in the range
  [S1:S1 + S2), and if so return the value S1 - (Int)S0. Else, they return the
  target of the default target, S2 + 1.

| LdSSwitchDestFast, D(TCA), S(Gen), NF

| LdSSwitchDestSlow, D(TCA), S(Gen), Er

  Load string switch destinations (two different compilation strategies).

| InterpOne<T,spOff,bcOff,numPopped,numPushed>, ND,
|                                               S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr),
|                                               Er

  Call the interpreter implementation function for one opcode. S0 + `spOff' (in
  cells) and S1 are, respectively, the VM stack and frame pointers before this
  instruction. T is only present if the instruction pushes to the stack, in
  which case it is the type of the top stack element after the call. `bcOff' is
  the bytecode offset. `numPopped' is the number of stack cells consumed by the
  instruction, and `numPushed' is the number of stack cells produced by the
  instruction.

| InterpOneCF<T,bcOff,numPopped,numPushed>, ND,
|                                           S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr),
|                                           T

  Similar to InterpOne, but for instructions that may modify vmpc. This is
  implemented as a tail call to a stub, so any exceptions thrown will be thrown
  in the context of the stub, not the InterpOneCF instruction.

| OODeclExists<kind>, D(Bool), S(Str) S(Bool), Er

  Returns a bool indicating whether the class, interface, or trait named by S0
  exists. Invokes autoload if S1 is true.

| SetOpCell<op>, ND, S(PtrToCell) S(Cell), Er

  Performs S0 <op>= S1.

  Load the context from the closure object S0 into D.

| StClosureCtx, ND, S(Obj) S(Ctx), CRc

  Store the context represented by S1 into the closure object S0. S1 may be a

  Store one of the closure environment arguments (i.e. from the closure's use
  clause) from S1 into the closure object S0.

|             CRc|PRc

  Create an AsyncFunctionWaitHandle object and suspend the ActRec provided by

| CreateAFWHNoVV, DAllocObj,
|                 S(FramePtr) C(Int) S(TCA,Nullptr) C(Int) S(Obj),
|                 CRc|PRc

  Create an AsyncFunctionWaitHandle object and suspend the ActRec provided by
  S0 into its embedded ActRec, allocating S1 slots for locals/iterators.  Set
  the native resume address to S2, resume offset to S3, and mark it blocked on
  non-finished child S4.  This version of the instruction guarantees that the
  VarEnv is unused.

| CreateSSWH, DAllocObj, S(Cell), CRc|PRc

  Call c_StaticWaitHandle::CreateSucceeded.

| AFWHPrepareChild, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Obj), Er

  Prepare unfinished WaitableWaitHandle object specified by S1 for getting
  awaited by an AsyncFunctionWaitHandle object specified by its ActRec
  provided by S0.

  cross-scheduler and intra-scheduler cycle detection. Throws if the
  dependency cannot be established.

| ContEnter<spOffset,returnBCOffset>, ND,
|                                     S(StkPtr) S(FramePtr) S(FramePtr) S(TCA),
|                                     Er

  Enters a generator body. S0 + `spOffset' (in cells) is a pointer to the
  stack, S1 is the current frame pointer, S2 is the generator frame pointer
  embedded in the Generator object, and S3 is the address to jump to. The
  `returnBCOffset' will be stored to the m_soff field of the pre-live ActRec on
  the stack.

| ContPreNext, ND, S(Obj) C(Bool), B

  Performs operations needed for the next() method of Generator object S0.
  If the generator is already running or finished, or it was not started yet
  and the S1 check-started flag is set, the branch B is taken. Otherwise,
  the generator is marked as running.

| ContStartedCheck, ND, S(Obj), B

  Checks if the Generator object S0 has started, and if not branches to
  block B.

  Special-case key update for generator, ActRec of which is S0, which
  increments the key of a generator if that generator's key is an Int.
  This will cause undefined behavior if the generator's key is not an Int.

| ContArIncIdx, D(Int), S(FramePtr), NF

  Increment the internal index in the Generator in S0, and return the new index
  value.

| ContArUpdateIdx, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Int), NF

  Loads the Generator object's ActRec, given a pointer to the generator
  object in S0.

| LdContResumeAddr, D(TCA), S(Obj), NF

  Loads 'key' from the Generator object ActRec of which is S0.

| StContArKey, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Gen), CRc

  Establish dependency between parent AsyncFunctionWaitHandle object, whose
  ActRec is given by S0, and child WaitableWaitHandle object referenced by S1.

  inlined function.

| LdWHState, D(Int), S(Obj), NF

  handle states in ext_asio.h. This instruction has undefined behavior if S0 is
  not a WaitHandle.

  Loads the Resumable object, given a Resumable's frame pointer in S0.


16. Debugging, instrumentation, and profiling

| IncStat, ND, C(Int) C(Int) C(Bool), NF

  Increment stat counter. S0 is the implementation defined stat counter index,
  S1 is the amount to increment the counter (may be negative), and S2 is a
  'force' flag. This opcode becomes a noop iff (force == false and runtime
  stats are not enabled) at translation time.

| IncTransCounter, ND, NA, NF

  Increment a translation counter.  This is probably something related to TC
  print.

| IncStatGrouped, ND, CStr CStr C(Int), NF

  Adds the value S2 to the counter named S1, in the category S0.

| IncProfCounter<TransID>, ND, NA, NF

  Increment the profiling counter associated with translation TransID.

| DbgAssertRefCount, ND, S(Gen), NF

  Assert that S0 has a valid refcount. If S0 has a reference counted type and
  its count is implausible then execute a hardware trap instruction.

| DbgAssertPtr, ND, S(PtrToGen), NF

  Assert that S0 points to plausible TypedValue. If the TypedValue is a type
  with a _count field, check that the count field is plausible using the same
  logic as DbgAssertRefCount. Internally this uses always_assert(); failures
  cause an abort (whatever always_assert does).

| DbgAssertType<T>, ND, S(Cell), NF

  Assert that S0 is of type T at runtime. If the assertion fails, execution is
  aborted via a hardware exception.

| DbgTraceCall<spOffset>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(StkPtr), NF

  When EvalHHIRGenerateAsserts is on, this instruction is inserted at the
  start of each region, to emit some sanity checking code.

| DbgAssertFunc, ND, S(Func) S(Func), NF

  fails, execution is aborted via a hardware exception.

| RBTraceEntry, ND, NA, NF

| RBTraceMsg, ND, NA, NF

  Ring buffer tracing.

| ZeroErrorLevel, D(Int), NA, NF

| RestoreErrorLevel, ND, S(Int), NF

  Helper instructions for fast implementation of the PHP error silencing
  operator (@foo()).


17. Iterators

| IterInit<IterData>,   D(Bool), S(Arr,Obj) S(FramePtr), Er|CRc

| IterInitK<IterData>,  D(Bool), S(Arr,Obj) S(FramePtr), Er|CRc

| WIterInit<IterData>,  D(Bool), S(Arr,Obj) S(FramePtr), Er|CRc

| WIterInitK<IterData>, D(Bool), S(Arr,Obj) S(FramePtr), Er|CRc

| MIterInit<T,IterData>,  D(Bool), S(BoxedCell) S(FramePtr), Er

| MIterInitK<T,IterData>, D(Bool), S(BoxedCell) S(FramePtr), Er

  <IterData> consists of three indices, iterId, keyId and valId. iterId is
  the index of the iterator variable, keyId and valId are indices of local
  variables.

  Initializes the iterator variable whose index is given by iterId.
  This instruction creates the appropriate iterator for the array or object that
  S0 references, and rewinds the new iterator to its start. S0 points to the
  stack frame containing the iterator and local variables with the indices
  iterId, keyId and valId.

  If the new iterator is at its end (i.e., has no elements to iterate over),
  this instruction decrements the refcount of S0 and returns false; otheriwse,
  it stores a reference to S0 in the new iterator and returns true. If the
  iterator is not at its end, then this instruction stores the iterator's first
  value (and key) into the local variable with index valId (and keyId,
  respectively).

  The IterInit and IterInitK instructions always copy the array element by
  value.

  The WIterInit and WIterInitK instructions copy referenced array elements by
  reference, and non-referenced array elements by value.

  The MIterInit and MIterInitK instructions always copy the array element by
  reference, and take a type parameter indicating the inner type of S0.  (This
  must have been proven via guards prior to running this opcode.)  Right now T
  must be Obj or Arr.

  This instruction has the ConsumesRC property because it either decrements the
  reference count of S0 or stores a reference to S0 into the new iterator.

| IterNext<IterData>,   D(Bool), S(FramePtr), Er

| IterNextK<IterData>,  D(Bool), S(FramePtr), Er

| WIterNext<IterData>,  D(Bool), S(FramePtr), Er

| WIterNextK<IterData>, D(Bool), S(FramePtr), Er

| MIterNext<IterData>,  D(Bool), S(FramePtr), NF

| MIterNextK<IterData>, D(Bool), S(FramePtr), NF

  <IterData> consists of three indices, iterId, keyId and valId. iterId is
  the index of the iterator variable, keyId and valId are indices of local
  variables.  S0 points to the stack frame containing the iterator and local
  variables with the indices iterId, keyId and valId.

  Advances the iterator variable whose index is given by iterId.

  If the iterator has reached the end, this instruction frees the iterator
  variable and returns false; otherwise, it returns true. If the iterator has
  not reached its end, then this instruction stores the iterator's next value
  (and key) into the local variable with index valId (and keyId, respectively).

  The IterInit and IterInitK instructions always copy the array element by
  value. The WIterInit and WIterInitK instructions copy referenced array
  elements by reference, and non-referenced array elements by value. The
  MIterNext and MIterNextK instructions always copy the array element by
  reference.

| IterFree,  ND, S(FramePtr), NF

| MIterFree, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Free the iterator variable whose index is given by S1 in the stack frame
  pointed to by S0.

| DecodeCufIter<iterId>, D(Bool), S(Arr,Obj,Str)  S(FramePtr), Er

  Decode S0 as a callable, and write the decoded values to the iterator
  specified by IterId. Returns true iff it successfully decoded the callable.
  Does not raise warnings, or throw exceptions.

| CIterFree<iterId>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Free the iterator variable whose index is given by IterId in the stack frame
  pointed to by S0.


18. Member instruction support

| LdMIStateAddr, D(PtrToMISGen), C(Int), NF

  Load an MInstrState address. Returns a pointer to offset S0 within the
  current MInstrState.

| LdMBase, DParam, NA, NF

  Load the current value of the member base register.

| StMBase, ND, S(PtrToGen), NF

  Store a new value to the member base register. It is illegal for any
  instruction other than StMBase or InterpOne (when interpreting a member
  instruction) to modify the member base register.

| FinishMemberOp, ND, NA, NF

  Mark the end of a member operation. This has no effect at runtime but exists
  to provide information for certain optimizations.

All of the remaining opcodes in this section are simple wrappers around helper
functions (specified in S0) to perform the corresponding vector operation. If
S1 is a ConstCls it represents the context class for the operation.

SetElem, SetProp, and SetNewElem are used to implement part of the SetM hhbc
opcode, which almost always pushes its first stack input or a CountedStr as its
stack result. The combinations of input types that cause SetM to push anything
other than those two values are vanishingly rare in correct PHP programs, so
these three instructions have been optimized for the common cases. SetNewElem
and SetProp have no destination, allowing the compiler to predict that the
SetM's output will be the same as its input (and optimize accordingly). If that
turns out to not be the case at runtime, the instruction will throw an
InvalidSetMException. The exception will hold a Cell containing the value the
SetM should push on the stack instead of its input value. The runtime is
responsible for catching this exception, finishing execution of the SetM
instruction, pushing the value from the exception on the stack, and proceeding
as appropriate (most likely with a side exit to the next bytecode instruction,
since it has pushed an unexpected type onto the stack).

SetElem is similar to SetProp and SetNewElem but can also be used for setting
characters within strings. When given a string base and a valid offset, SetElem
returns a string representation of the newly inserted character. In all other
cases it returns nullptr or throws an InvalidSetMException. It will throw this
exception when it detects invalid input types, or when trying to set a string
offset that would grow the string beyond the maximum supported size.

The input types that will cause the errors described above are listed here:

SetNewElem will fail if the base is not a subtype of {Null|Str|Arr|Obj} and not
           Bool<false>.
SetElem has the same base constraint as SetNewElem. In addition, the key must
        not be a subtype of {Arr|Obj}.
SetProp will fail if the base is not a subtype of {Obj|Null}.

Any instructions that take a pointer to an MInstrState struct use the various
fields of that struct for holding intermediate values.

| BaseG, D(PtrToRMembCell), S(Str), Er

  Get a base from global named S0.

  NB: BaseG returns either a PtrToGblGen, OR a pointer to a ref that is rooted
  in a GblGen.  (I.e. the unbox happens in the C++ helper that this instruction
  calls.)  If it is not a defining BaseG it can also return the
  init_null_variant, so for now it returns a PtrToRMembCell.

| PropX, D(PtrToMembGen), S(Obj,PtrToGen) S(Cell) S(PtrToMISGen), Er

  Lookup intermediate property in S0, with key S1.

| PropQ, D(PtrToMembGen), S(Obj,PtrToGen) S(StaticStr) S(PtrToMISGen), Er

  A nullsafe version of PropX, returns null if the base S0 is null.

  Like PropX, but used for intermediate element lookups that may modify the
  base.

  Set op propery with key S1 in base S0, using S2 as the right hand side.

| IncDecProp<op>, D(Cell),

|                 MProp|PRc|Er

  Increment/decrement property with key S1 in base S0.

| EmptyProp, D(Bool), S(Obj,PtrToGen) S(Cell), Er

  Returns true iff the property with key S1 in base S0 is empty.

| IssetProp, D(Bool), S(Obj,PtrToGen) S(Cell), Er

  Returns true iff the property with key S1 in base S0 is set.

| ElemX, D(PtrToMembGen), S(PtrToGen) S(Cell) S(PtrToMISGen), Er

  Get intermediate element with key S1 from base S0. The base will not be
  modified.

| ProfileMixedArrayOffset, ND, S(Arr) S(Int,Str), NF

  Profile the offset of the element keyed by S1 in S0.

| CheckMixedArrayOffset<pos>, ND, AK(Mixed) S(Int,Str), B

  Check that `pos' is within the usage bounds of S0 (including tombstones), and
  that S1 exactly matches the element key of S0 at `pos'.  If any of the checks
  fail, branch to B.  This check is allowed to have false negatives, in the
  case of int-like strings.

| CheckArrayCOW, ND, S(Arr), B

  Check that S0 has a refcount of exactly 1; if not, branch to B.

| ElemArray,  D(PtrToMembGen), S(Arr) S(Int,Str), Er

| ElemArrayW, D(PtrToMembGen), S(Arr) S(Int,Str), Er

| ElemArrayD<T>, D(PtrToElemGen), S(PtrToGen) S(Int,Str), MElem|Er

| ElemArrayU<T>, D(PtrToMembGen), S(PtrToGen) S(Int,Str), MElem|Er

  Similar to ElemX, but the base S0 is an array and the key S1 is an int/str.
  ElemArrayW is for Warn member instrs, ElemArrayD is for Define member instrs,
  and ElemArrayU is for Unset.

  ElemArray{D,U} both take a PtrToGen for the base operand, but expect it to be
  a PtrToArr or PtrToBoxedArr.  T is the type of the base array.

| ElemMixedArrayK<pos>, D(PtrToMembGen), AK(Mixed) S(Int,Str), NF

  Like ElemArray, but the element for S1 is at a known position `pos' in S0.

| ElemDX, D(PtrToMembGen), S(PtrToGen) S(Cell) S(PtrToMISGen), MElem|Er

  Like ElemX, but used for intermediate element lookups that may modify the
  base.

| ElemUX, D(PtrToMembGen), S(PtrToGen) S(Cell) S(PtrToMISGen), MElem|Er

  Like ElemX, but used for intermediate element lookups that may modify the
  base as part of an unset operation.

| ArrayGet, DArrElem, S(Arr) S(Int,Str), Er

  Get element with key S1 from base S0.

| MixedArrayGetK<pos>, DArrElem, AK(Mixed) S(Int,Str), NF

  Like ArrayGet, but the element for S1 is at a known position `pos' in S0.

| StringGet, D(StaticStr), S(Str) S(Int), PRc|Er

  Get string representing character at position S1 from base string S0.  Raises
  a notice if the position is out of bounds.

| MapGet, D(Cell), S(Obj) S(Int,Str), PRc|Er

  Get element with key S1 from base S0.

| CGetElem, D(Cell), S(PtrToGen) S(Cell), PRc|Er

  Get element with key S1 from S0.

  Bind element with key S1 in base S0 to the reference S2.

| ArraySet, D(Arr), S(Arr) S(Int,Str) S(Cell), PRc|CRc|Er

  Set element with key S1 in S0 to S2. The dest will be a new Array that should
  replace S0.

| ArraySetRef, ND, S(Arr) S(Int,Str) S(Cell) S(BoxedCell), CRc|Er

  Like ArraySet, but for binding operations on the array. S3 must point to a
  RefData with an array type when this instruction is executed, and it must be
  the same array that is in S0.

| MapSet, ND, S(Obj) S(Int,Str) S(Cell), Er

  Set element with key S1 in S0 to S2.

| SetElem, DSetElem, S(PtrToGen) S(Cell) S(Cell), MElem|PRc|Er

  Set element with key S1 in S0 to S2. SetElem returns a Nullptr in the common
  case, where the logical result of the hhbc SetM is its right hand side. In
  the case of string bases, the SetM returns a new string containing the newly
  inserted character. So the return value of this instruction is Nullptr unless
  SetM needed to create a new counted string.

  Furthermore, in the case of "invalid offsets", SetElem may throw an
  InvalidSetMException (see discussion above).

| SetWithRefElem, ND, S(PtrToGen) S(Gen) S(Gen), MElem|Er

  Set element with key S1 in S0 to S2.

| UnsetElem, ND, S(PtrToGen) S(Cell), MElem|Er

  Unsets the element at key S1 in the base S0.

|                S(PtrToGen) S(Cell) S(Cell),
|                MElem|PRc|Er

  Set op elem with key S1 in base S0, using S2 as the right hand side.

| IncDecElem, D(Cell), S(PtrToGen) S(Cell), MElem|PRc|Er

  Returns true iff the element at key S1 in the base S0 is set.

| PairIsset, D(Bool), S(Obj) S(Int), NF

  Returns true iff the element at key S1 in the base S0 is set.

| MapIsset, D(Bool), S(Obj) S(Int,Str), NF

  Returns true iff the element at key S1 in the base S0 is set.

  Returns true iff the element at key S1 in S0 is set.

| EmptyElem, D(Bool), S(PtrToGen) S(Cell), Er

  Returns true iff the element at key S1 in S0 is set and not equal (as defined
  by the hhbc Eq instruction) to false.

| CheckRange, D(Bool), S(Int) S(Int), NF

  Returns true iff S0 is in the range [0, S1).

| ThrowOutOfBounds, ND, S(Int), Er|T

  Throws an OutOfBoundsException with a message indicating S0.

| ThrowInvalidOperation, ND, S(Str), Er|T

  Throws an InvalidOperationException with a message indicating S0.

| ThrowArithmeticError, ND, S(Str), Er|T

  Throws an ArithmeticError with a message indicating S0.

| ThrowDivisionByZeroError, ND, S(Str), Er|T

  Throws a DivisionByZeroError with a message indicating S0.

| ProfileArrayKind, ND, S(Arr), NF

  Profile the array kind of S0.

| ProfileStructArray, ND, S(Arr), NF

  Profile type of array S0 (i.e. whether it is a StructArray or some other kind
  and if it is a StructArray what Shapes it saw).

| ProfileType, ND, S(Gen), NF

  Profile the type of S0.

| ProfileMethod<rdsHandle,spOff>, ND, S(StkPtr) S(Cls,Nullptr), NF

  Profile the Func in the ActRec that was just pushed onto the stack.

| LdStructArrayElem, DArrElem, AK(Struct) S(StaticStr), NF

  Loads the element of the struct array in S0 at offset S1. This instruction
  assumes that the key for that particular offset was already present in the
  array, which previous guards should guarantee.

| CheckPackedArrayBounds, ND, AK(Packed) S(Int), B

  Checks that the index in S1 is within the bounds of the packed array in S0.
  Branches to B if the index is out of bounds.

| LdPackedArrayElemAddr<T>, DParamPtr(Elem), AK(Packed) S(Int), NF

  Load the address of the element at index S1 of the packed array in S0.

| LdVectorSize, D(Int), S(Obj), NF

  Returns the size of the given Vector in S0.

| VectorDoCow, ND, S(Obj), NF

  Triggers a copy on write for a Vector that has a live ImmVector sharing
  the same copy of the elements.

| VectorHasImmCopy, ND, S(Obj), B

  Given a vector, check if it has a immutable copy and jump to the taken branch
  if so.

| ColAddNewElemC, DofS(0), S(Obj) S(Cell), Er|CRc|P

  Adds item S0 to the end of collection S0. Throws a fatal error if S0 is not a
  collection. Returns S0.

| MapAddElemC, DofS(0), S(Obj) S(Cell) S(Cell), Er|CRc|P

  Adds item to a Map or ImmMap. Inserts item S2 into collection S0 at key S1.
  Throws a fatal error if S0 is not a collection. Returns S0.

| ColIsEmpty, D(Bool), S(Obj), NF

| ColIsNEmpty, D(Bool), S(Obj), NF

  Returns whether a collection instance is empty or not.  S0 must be known to
  be an instance of a collection class at compile time.


19. Exception/unwinding support

| BeginCatch, ND, NA, NF

  Marks the beginning of a catch region. Exact behavior is implementation and
  architecture specific.

| EndCatch<spOffset>, ND, S(FramePtr) S(StkPtr), T

  Marks the end of a catch region and returns control to the unwinder.  The
  `spOffset' field represents a logical adjustment to S1 (in cells) to yield
  the vm stack pointer, however the stack pointer is not actually adjusted
  before this instruction returns control to the unwinder.  The unwinder
  instead relies on fixup map information to find the appropriate stack
  pointers.  Instead it's part of this instruction to facilitate assertions and
  memory effect analysis.

| UnwindCheckSideExit, ND, S(FramePtr) S(StkPtr), B

  Branches to B if the currently executing catch region should return control
  to the unwinder rather than side exiting.  Used to control behavior in catch
  traces for the InvalidSetMException and TVCoercionException situations.

| LdUnwinderValue<T>, DParam, NA, PRc

  Loads the value contained by the current unwinder exception.


20. Function prologues

| EnterFrame, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Stash the return address of the call in m_savedRip.

| CheckStackOverflow, ND, S(FramePtr), Er

  Check if the stack depth has exceeded its limit.  If it has, jump to the
  stack overflow helper stub, which will throw.

| InitExtraArgs<func,argc>, ND, S(FramePtr), NF

  Set up the ExtraArgs struct on the live ActRec.  If extra args are present
  and need to be discarded, they will be decref'd and may re-enter to run
  destructors.

| InitCtx, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Ctx), CRc

  Store S1 to the m_this/m_cls field in the frame pointer S0.

  If InitCtx appears in an IR unit, it must dominate all occurrences of LdCtx
  and LdCctx.

| CheckSurpriseFlagsEnter<func,argc>, ND, S(FramePtr), Er

  Test the implementation-specific surprise flags.  If they're nonzero, call
  the function enter helper.

| CheckSurpriseAndStack<func,args>, ND, S(FramePtr), Er

  Test surprise flags and stack overflow at the same time.

| CheckARMagicFlag, ND, S(FramePtr), B

  If the MagicDispatch flags on the ActRec pointed to by the frame pointer S0
  are not set, branch to block B.

| LdARNumArgsAndFlags, D(Int), S(FramePtr), NF

  Load the value of m_numArgsAndFlags on the ActRec pointed to by the frame
  pointer S0.

| StARNumArgsAndFlags, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Int), CRc

  Store S1 to m_numArgsAndFlags on the ActRec pointed to by the frame pointer
  S0.

| LdARInvName, D(Str), S(FramePtr), NF

  Load the value of m_invName off the ActRec pointed to by the frame pointer S0.
  The compiler should generate this only if it knows that m_invName is a
  StringData* (rather than, e.g., a VarEnv*).

| StARInvName, ND, S(FramePtr) S(Str,Nullptr), CRc

  Store S1 to m_invName on the ActRec pointed to by the frame pointer S0.

| PackMagicArgs, D(Arr), S(FramePtr), PRc

  Call PackedArray::MakePacked() with the value of numArgs() on the ActRec
  pointed to by the frame pointer S0 as the first argument, and the pointer to
  the first parameter in the frame as the second argument.

| LdTVAux<ValidBits>, D(Int), S(Gen), NF

  Load the value of m_aux from the TypedValue S0.  ValidBits is a mask
  specifying which bits are allowed to be set.  The runtime may ignore it.
