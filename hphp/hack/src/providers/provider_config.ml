(* NOTE: we can't simply use a string as a key. In the case of a name conflict,
we may put e.g. a function named 'foo' into the cache whose value is one type,
and then later try to withdraw a class named 'foo' whose value is another type.

The problem can be solved with a GADT, but making a GADT with references to
types like `Typing_defs.ty` causes dependency cycles, since `typing` ends up
depending on `Provider_config` transitively.
