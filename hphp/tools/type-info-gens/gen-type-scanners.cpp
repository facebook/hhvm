/*
 * Program responsible for taking the parsed debug-information from TypeParser,
 * analyzing it (along with user-provided annotations), and generating C++ code
 * for GC type-scanners. These type-scanners will then be compiled into a shared
 * object which can be loaded at start-up if GC is enabled.
 *
 * Some general concepts:
 *
 * - "Scanner". A scanner is responsible for reporting pointer information about
 *    a set of types to the GC. Generally it will report a list of pointers to
 *    other potentially interesting types, as well as address ranges that should
 *    be conservatively scanned.
 *
 * - "Countable". A type is countable if MarkCountable<> or
 *   MarkScannableCountable<> is instantiated on it. Type-scanners are never
 *   generated for countable types, it is assumed their scanners will be
 *   hand-written. The exception is if MarkScannableCountable<> is used, in
 *   which case they'll be scanned if explicitly requested. The point of the
 *   type-scanners is to determine how to find pointers to countable types from
 *   other types. Countable types correspond to the set of types in HHVM which
 *   are explicitly managed by the GC.
 *
 * - "Indexed". An indexed type is a combination of a type and an action. These
 *   occur from an instantiation of Indexer<>. Any particular type can be part
 *   of multiple indexed types but with different actions. Every indexed type
 *   receives a unique type-index and will have a scanner generated for
 *   it. Belonging to an indexed type generally marks that the type is allocated
 *   on the req-heap (with one exception). The action influences the behavior of
 *   that particular scanner. They are:
 *
 *        (*) Ignore -- Scanner is trivial.
 *        (*) Auto -- The default. Attempt to generate scanner automatically.
 *        (*) Conservative<T...> -- If any of T... is "interesting" (see below),
 *                                  conservative scan. Otherwise, ignore.
 *                                  If T... is an empty list, always
 *                                  conservative scan.
 *        (*) WithSuffix<T> -- Attempt to generate scanner for type as normal.
 *                             However, any allocation of the type only contains
 *                             one instance of that type. Any remaining
 *                             allocated memory is assumed to be filled with
 *                             instances of T. So, a scanner for T will be
 *                             generated as well.
 *        (*) ForScan -- Similar to Auto, but this type should not be marked as
 *                       "pointer followable" (see below) if this is the only
 *                       indexed type for the type. (This is a marker that the
 *                       type is never actually req-heap allocated).
 *
 * - "Interesting". A type is interesting if the scanner generated for it would
 *   be non-trivial. IE, it would have at least one action. Interesting
 *   types either contain interesting types, pointers to "pointer
 *   followable" types, or have some custom action defined on it.
 *
 * - "Pointer followable". A type is pointer followable if it is a countable
 *   type, it has a countable type as a base, or if it is a member of at least
 *   one indexed type which has an action which is not "ForScan" and is
 *   interesting. By these conditions, a pointer followable type is one which is
 *   known to be allocated out of the request heap, and transitively leads to a
 *   countable type via some chain of pointers. Pointers to pointer followable
 *   types are enqueued inside scanners. Pointers to non-pointer followable
 *   types are ignored. All base classes of pointer followable object types are
 *   also pointer followable (to handle polymorphism).
 *
 * - "Layout". Abstract description of a scanner. A layout contains a list of
 *   offsets and actions to perform at those offsets. Since many types have
 *   similar structure, multiple types can share the same layout.
 *
 * The goal of the scanner generator is find the maximal set of pointer
 * followable types, use those to compute the layout of each indexed type, then
 * output those layouts in the form of C++ code.
 *
 * Note: this entire scheme assumes that all pointer followable types can be
 * reached via some indexed type. If not, that pointer followable type is a
 * root, and must be dealt with specially by the GC.

 * templated types, like req::ptr<>).
 *
 * A layout can currently contain three different types of actions. The first is
 * to report the value of a pointer at a certain offset. The second is to
 * conservative scan a range given by a start offset and a length. The last is
 * to invoke a custom function (with a certain symbol), passing a pointer formed
 * by the offset as the first parameter (which serves as the this pointer).
 *
 * A layout can also have a suffix layout. Normally, for a given block of
 * memory, the layout will be applied contiguously until the entire block is
 * processed. However, if the layout has a suffix layout, the base layout is
 * only applied once on the beginning of the block. The suffix layout will be
 * applied contiguously on the remaining portion of the block. This is to handle
