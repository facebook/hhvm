 * The Revision tracker tracks the latest known global revision of the repo,
 * the corresponding global revisions of Hg revisions, and the sequence of
 * revision changes (from hg update). See record type "env" below.
 *
 * This machinery is necessary because Watchman state change events give
 * us only the HG Revisions of hg updates, but we need to make decisions
 * on their global Revision numbers.
 *
 * We want to be able to:
 *  1) Determine when the base global revision (in trunk) has changed
 *     "significantly" so we can inform the server monitor to trigger
 *     a server restart (since incremental typechecks can be slower
 *     than a fresh server using a saved state).
 *  2) Fulfill goal 1 without blocking, and while being "highly responsive"
 *
 * The definition of "significant" can be adjusted according to how fast
 * incremental type checking is compared to a fresh restart.
 *
 * The meaning of "highly responsive" above roughly means using a cache
 * for global revisions (because a Mercurial request to get the global revision
 * number of an HG Revision is very slow, on the order of seconds).
 * Consider the following scenario:
 *
 *   Server is running with Repo at Revision 100. User does hg update to
 *   Rev 500 (which triggers a server restart) and works on that for
 *   an hour. Then the user hg updates back to Rev 100.
 *
 * At this point, the server restart should be triggered because we
 * are moving across hundreds of revisions. Without caching the Revision
 * 100 result, the restart would be delayed by seconds. With a cache, the
 * restart is triggered immediately.
 *
 * We use an SCM Aware Watchman subscription to follow when the merge base
 * changes. We use State Enter and Leave events (which appear before the
 * slower SCM Aware notification) to kick off asynchronous computation. In
 * particular, we kick off prefetching of a saved state, and shelling out
 * to mercurial for mapping the HG Revision to its corresponding global revision
 * (since our "distance" measure uses global_revs which are
 * monotonically increasing)..
