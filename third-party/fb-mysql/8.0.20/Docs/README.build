Build Instructions for MySQL Server
===================================

The recommended way to build MySQL for developers:

cd <some build directory>
cmake <path to source directory>
make

This will give you a release build, with compiler options taken from
../cmake/build_configurations/compiler_options.cmake
and "feature set" taken from
../cmake/build_configurations/feature_set.cmake

Adding -DWITH_DEBUG=1 to the cmake command line gives you a debug build.


Building on Windows is slightly different:
cd <some build directory>
cmake <path to source directory> -G <generator>

We only support Visual Studio as generator and only 64 bit ("Win64").

cmake --build . --config Debug
or
cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo


If you have special needs, you can disable the defaults by setting
these cmake variables off:

WITH_DEFAULT_COMPILER_OPTIONS
WITH_DEFAULT_FEATURE_SET

Building MySQL from source requires SSL headers and libraries to be
available. The default value for the cmake variable WITH_SSL is "system".
This means that on UNIX systems, you should install the appropriate
OpenSSL developer package.

For Windows users, please see
   https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries
For Mac users, please see
   http://brewformulas.org/Openssl

You may also build OpenSSL yourself, and do
   cmake -DWITH_SSL=</path/to/custom/openssl>
in order to build MySQL.

It is possible to compile with Clang on Windows, which compiles faster
and also yields faster binaries, but this is experimental and not officially
supported. To compile, use LLVM 6.0.1 or newer from releases.llvm.org
(Clang/C2, which is Microsoft's own version of Clang, is not supported),
and put a Windows compile of Ninja in your path. Then execute the following
in a shell:

  "c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64
  set PATH=<path to Ninja>;%PATH%
  "c:\Program Files\CMake 3.8\bin\cmake.exe" -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="c:/program files/llvm/msbuild-bin/cl.exe" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="c:/program files/llvm/msbuild-bin/cl.exe" -DCMAKE_LINKER="c:/program files/llvm/bin/lld-link.exe" -DWITH_BOOST=<path to Boost> ..
  ninja

This configuration also supports ASAN (-DWITH_ASAN=1), although currently only
when linking with MSVC's linker (not with LLD).

For running tests with --parallel, you may need to add --build-thread= (500 is
a reasonable value to try).

Note: For building with unit tests, you need to tell cmake where to find
the sources, see ../unittest/gunit/CMakeLists.txt
You should *not* 'make install' googletest/googlemock on your system,
the libraries must be built from source, with the unit tests.

Note: You need to tell cmake where to find boost, see ../cmake/boost.cmake
