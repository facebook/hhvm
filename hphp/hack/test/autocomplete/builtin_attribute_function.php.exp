__CrossPackage
  INSERT __CrossPackage
  built-in attribute
  Enables access to elements from other package(s), requires `<<file:__EnableUnstableFeatures('package')>>`
__Deprecated
  INSERT __Deprecated
  built-in attribute
  Mark a function/method as deprecated.  The type checker will show an error at call sites, and a runtime notice is raised if this function/method is called.
  
  The optional second argument specifies a sampling rate for raising notices at runtime. If the sampling rate is 100, a notice is only raised every 1/100 calls. If omitted, the default sampling rate is 1 (i.e. all calls raise notices). To disable runtime notices, use a sampling rate of 0.
__DynamicallyCallable
  INSERT __DynamicallyCallable
  built-in attribute
  Allows this function/method to be called dynamically, based on a string of its name.  HHVM will warn or error (depending on settings) on dynamic calls to functions without this attribute.
  
  See also `HH\dynamic_fun()` and `HH\dynamic_class_meth()`.
__EntryPoint
  INSERT __EntryPoint
  built-in attribute
  Execution of the program will start here. This only applies in the first file executed, `__EntryPoint` in required or autoloaded files has no effect.
__Memoize
  INSERT __Memoize
  built-in attribute
  Cache the return values from this function/method. Calls with the same arguments will return the cached value.
  
  Caching is per-request and shared between subclasses (see also `__MemoizeLSB`).
__ReturnDisposable
  INSERT __ReturnDisposable
  built-in attribute
  Allows a function/method to return a value that implements `IDisposable` or `IAsyncDisposable`. The function must return a fresh disposable value by either instantiating a class or  returning a value from another method/function marked `__ReturnDisposable`.
