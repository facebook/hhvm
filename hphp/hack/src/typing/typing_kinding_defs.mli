(** The main representation of kinds in Hack. A record r of OCaml type kind can both represent
  fully-applied Hack types (e.g., of kind * ) and higher-kinded types.
  If r.parameters = [], we have a fully applied type.
  Otherwise, if, for example r.parameters = [(n1, r1); (n2;r2)], then
  r represents a type constructor with two (curried) arguments
  (i.e., r stands for kind * -> * -> * ).
  Here, n1 and n2 are the names of those parameters. The names are then bound
  and can be used in the involved constraints (unless the name is the wildcarf name _ ).
  In the example above, this means that n1 and n2 are bound in the constraints of r1 and r2, as well as
  r.upper_bounds and r.lower_bounds.

  parameter at hand. All error functions must be aware of this and not print the dummy name. *)
val dummy_name : Aast.sid

(** Simple kinds are used in situations where we want to check well-kindedness, but
  ignore type constraints. Most importantly, this is used in Typing_phase.
  In other words, simple kinds can be seen as kinds that are just built from * and ->,
  whereas full kinds *additionally* also carry constraints.
  For technical reasons, simple kinds must, however, carry some degree of information about
  bounds: During localiazation, we may come across a type like T<_>, where the user provided
  a wildcard for the type argument and T is either a (higher-kinded) type parameter or a
  class/type name. In this case, we introduce a fresh type parameter in the environment, which
  is used as an abstract type standing in for the type argument. We then add those constraints
  to the fresh parameter that T imposes on its type parameter.
  To this end, we need to know the constraints T imposes on its parameters, while only having the
  kind of T at hand. To this end, simple kinds carry around constraints at the toplevel.
  However, the nested kinds (i.e., the kinds of the type parameters) always have empty constraints.

  Implementation note: Internally, simple and full kinds are represented similarly. Using two
  different types for them is mostly a matter of hygiene, in order to prevent mixing up the two
  sorts of kinds. Therefore, we keep the type of simple kinds abstract here.
