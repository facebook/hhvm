description: >
  When growing the value stack, shift minimum size right by this amount to
  come up with a slack which is allocated on top of the minimum required
  size.  The slack increases memory usage a bit, but reduces value stack
  reallocations when the minimum size grows.  A value of 2 means that a
  25% slack is used.  Undefine to remove any slack, value stack is then
  always grown by the minimum amount possible.
