warning: Lint[5655] This is a cross-boundary edge. Although the callee is already in the caller package pkg1 via __PackageOverride('pkg1'), cross-boundary edges contribute to the bloating of pkg1 and SHOULD BE REMOVED. Either move the callee into the caller's package via hg mv, use __RequirePackage (if the whole function should only be invoked from pkg1) or gate this reference via a package check (if this portion of the function is meant to be gated by an environment check).
