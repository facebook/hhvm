*** Test copy() function: checking case sensitivity in creation of destination file names ***
Size of the source file before copy operation => int(1500)

-- Now applying copy() on source file to create copies --
-- Iteration 1 --
Copy operation => bool(true)
Existence of destination file => bool(true)
Destination file name => %s/COPY.tmp
Size of source file => int(1500)
Size of destination file => int(1500)

-- Iteration 2 --
Copy operation => bool(true)
Existence of destination file => bool(true)
Destination file name => %s/COPY.TMP
Size of source file => int(1500)
Size of destination file => int(1500)

-- Iteration 3 --
Copy operation => bool(true)
Existence of destination file => bool(true)
Destination file name => %s/CopY.TMP
Size of source file => int(1500)
Size of destination file => int(1500)
