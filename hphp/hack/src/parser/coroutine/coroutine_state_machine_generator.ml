(*
Consider a coroutine such as
coroutine function foo() : void {
  suspend blah();
  suspend blah();
}

There is an implicit "return;" at the end, and we'll need to rewrite this as

function foo_rewritten(...) : CoroutineResult<Unit> {
   ...
   $closure->label = -1;
   return new ActualCoroutineResult(coroutine_unit());
   ...
}

However we can avoid introducing the extra return if the end point of the
method is unreachable. A method which already ends with a return or throw
has an unreachable endpoint, so there would be no way to reach the
introduced return.

As a small optimization we avoid generating the extra return if we know that
the method endpoint is reachable.

TODO: Is this optimization reasonable? We could simply generate it always.
It doesn't add that much extra code.

 * Transforms suspend expressions recursively.
 *
 * Extracts a "prefix" list of statements, and transforms the suspend expression
 * into a variable that will contain the result of the suspended expression
 * after resumption.
 *
 * In particular, we perform a post-order traversal of the tree. Therefore, we
 * process the deepest suspend operations before ones that depend on them, and
 * we guarantee that we will never encounter another suspend operator while
 * processing a suspend operator. For these suspend operations, we extract a
 * list of statements to execute before the suspend operation. These statements
 * are reported to the calling function. The calling function is responsible for
 * ensuring that these statemnets are executed before the transformed node. The
 * transformed node itself is rewritten into $coroutineData. The list of
 * statements will ensure that $coroutineData contains the result of the suspend
 * operation at the point in time that the suspend operation is completed.
 *
 * As an example, consider this expression.
 *
 *   suspend outerCoroutine(suspend innerCoroutine(), otherMethod())
 *
 * This is a PrefixUnaryExpression and will produce the following statement
 * list. For demonstrative purposes, we assume that the next label number is 1.

  (* We have, say

  if (suspend x()) a;

  The recursion here is slightly tricky. We know that we can reduce the first
  "elseif" to an "else if". That is, the code above is equivalent to:

  if (suspend x()) a;
  else {
    if(suspend y()) b;
    elseif (suspend z()) c;

  So the first thing we do is construct the interior "if". It has one fewer
  "elseif" than before, so we've made a smaller problem that we can solve
  recursively. We recursively rewrite it, and then that becomes the "else"
  of the outer "if". Finally we can recurse a second time to rewrite the outer
  "if". The final result is:

  {
    $tx = suspend x();
    if ($tx) a;

      $ty = suspend y();
