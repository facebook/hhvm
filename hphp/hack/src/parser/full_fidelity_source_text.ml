(**
 * This is an abstraction over source files used by the full-fidelity lexer.
 * Right now it is just a thin wrapper over a string, but in the future I'd
 * like to enhance this to efficiently support operations such as:
 *
 * - representing many different portions of a file without duplicating text
 * - lazily loading content from files
 * - caching file contents intelligently
 * - reporting when files are updated perhaps?
 *
 * We might not need all of these things, but it will be nice to have an
 * abstraction when we need some of them.
