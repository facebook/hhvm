<?php

/* foreach by reference has an interesting interaction with array_pop.
 * array_pop will reset the internal array pointer, but it will not reset the
 * foreach by reference array pointer; instead it will rewind it if the array
 * shrinks past the current position. This means that you can array_pop some
 * things off (including the current element), then append other things, and
 * iteration will resume at the first element that was added. This needs to
 * work even if the array grows before you start to array_pop, but _not_ if
 * there is a copy due to refcount != 1 before you start to array pop (in that
 * case iteration restarts from the internal array pointer, which array_pop
 * has reset). PHP is awesome like that.
