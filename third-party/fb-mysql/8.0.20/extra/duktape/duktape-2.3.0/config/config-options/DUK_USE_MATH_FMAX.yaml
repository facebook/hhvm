  Assume platform function fmax() is available and works correctly.
  Some platforms don't have fmax() (it is defined in C99) and on some
  platforms (e.g. some uclibc environments) it may not be provided even
  though the compilation environment is nominally C99.

  Removed in Duktape 2.0.0: if the platform doesn't have fmax(), simply
  define a replacement for DUK_FMAX().
