This is a point-in-time snapshot of the API documentation from January 2026.
Going forward, we will not be maintaining a public copy of these references,
and recommend users to refer to the built-in signature helpers available in
the Hack LSP instead for complete and up-to-date information.

Initialize an MCRouter handle




``` Hack
public function __construct(
  darray<string, mixed> $options,
  string $pid = '',
): void;
```




See: https://github.com/facebook/mcrouter/wiki
See: https://github.com/facebook/mcrouter/blob/master/
mcrouter/mcrouter_options_list.h




## Parameters




+ ` darray<string, mixed> $options `
+ ` string $pid = '' `




## Returns




* ` void `




## Examples




The following example shows you how to explicitly create an instance of [` MCRouter `](/apis/Classes/MCRouter/) using `` new ``, by definition, its constructor. You must create a configuration string (or provide a configuration file that contains appropriate configuration information), and, optionally, a persistence identifier can bet passed as the second parameter to the constructor.




~~~ basic-usage.hack
$servers = Vector {\getenv('HHVM_TEST_MCROUTER')};
// For many use cases, calling MCRouter::createSimple($servers) would
// suffice here. But this shows you how to explicitly create the configuration
// options for creating an instance of MCRouter
$options = darray[
  'config_str' => \json_encode(
    darray[
      'pools' => darray[
        'P' => darray[
          'servers' => $servers,
        ],
      ],
      'route' => 'PoolRoute|P',
    ],
  ),
];
$mc = new \MCRouter($options); // could also pass a persistence id string here
\var_dump($mc is \MCRouter);
