description: >
  Enable "compression" of arbitrary data pointers into an unsigned 16-bit
  value.  Use together with DUK_USE_DATAPTR_ENC16 and DUK_USE_DATAPTR_DEC16.

  Pointers compressed are any void pointers in C code, not just the Duktape
  heap.  Also NULL pointer must encode and decode correctly.

  Currently it is required that NULL encodes to integer 0, and integer
  0 decodes to NULL.  No other pointer can be encoded to 0.

  NOTE: This feature option is currently unimplemented, i.e. Duktape won't
  compress any data pointers at the moment.
