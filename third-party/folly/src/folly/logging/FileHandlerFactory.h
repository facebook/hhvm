 * FileHandlerFactory is a LogHandlerFactory that constructs log handlers
 * that write to a file.
 *
 * Note that FileHandlerFactory allows opening and appending to arbitrary files
 * based on the handler options.  This may make it unsafe to use
 * FileHandlerFactory in some contexts: for instance, a setuid binary should
 * generally avoid registering the FileHandlerFactory if they allow log
 * handlers to be configured via command line parameters, since otherwise this
 * may allow non-root users to append to files that they otherwise would not
 * have write permissions for.
