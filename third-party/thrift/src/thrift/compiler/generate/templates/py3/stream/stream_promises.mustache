Included from CythonServices.pyx, it defines a Python wrapper for each type
of C++ promise that needs to be returned to C++. Cython doesn't support
templating on Python classes. This file is necessary primarily because the
cPromise shared_ptr needs to point to a promise that wraps a specific return
type in C++. The Python wrapper then gets passed into a coroutine where the
promise can have it's value set after the handler coroutine has finished
executing.
