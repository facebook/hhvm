.PP
\fBndb_waiter\fR
repeatedly (each 100 milliseconds) prints out the status of all cluster data nodes until either the cluster reaches a given status or the
\fB\-\-timeout\fR
limit is exceeded, then exits\&. By default, it waits for the cluster to achieve
STARTED
status, in which all nodes have started and connected to the cluster\&. This can be overridden using the
\fB\-\-no\-contact\fR
and
\fB\-\-not\-started\fR
options\&.
.PP
The node states reported by this utility are as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3

NO_CONTACT: The node cannot be contacted\&.

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
UNKNOWN: The node can be contacted, but its status is not yet known\&. Usually, this means that the node has received a
START

RESTART
command from the management server, but has not yet acted on it\&.

.RS 4

RESTART
command\&.

Prior to NDB 8\&.0\&.20, this program printed
NDBT_ProgramExit \- \fIstatus\fR
upon completion of its run, due to an unnecessary dependency on the
NDBT
testing library\&. This dependency has been removed, eliminating the extraneous output\&.
