/**
 * A simple way of using this is to have a Preparable object which has (at
 * least) one method: prepare($pass).  An example of this object might be:
 *
 * class GetSecondDegreeFriends extends Preparable {
 *   public function __construct($user) {
 *     $this->user = $user;
 *   }
 *
 *   public function prepare($pass) {
 *     switch ($pass) {
 *     case 0:
 *       user_multiget_reciprocal_friends((array)$this->user, true,
 *                                        $this->friends);
 *       return true; // falls through below
 *     case 1:
 *       user_multiget_reciprocal_friends($this->friends[$this->user]), true,
 *                                        $this->second_degree_friends);
 *     }
 *     return false;
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Preparables may also be composed. When in the context of a Preparable,
 * you may add other preparables to the $preparer via:
 *
 * // The next pass of the current preparable will not be executed until the
 * // OtherPreparable is finished
 * $preparer->waitFor(new OtherPreparable());
 *
 * // The current preparable may advance, but will not complete (and hence
 * // anything depending upon it will not advance) until the OtherPreparable
 * // is complete. If thinking about the dependency graph as a tree, these
 * // Preparables become siblings, and the parent will not continue until
 * // each of its children have completed.
 * $preparer->runSibling(new OtherPreparable());
 *
 * Note: as a convention, any method that should never be overridden/called from
 * outside flib/core/cache is prefixed with double underscores.  These methods
 * are public, as they need to be called from the Preparer.  If you are not the
 * Preparer, do not call them.
 *
 * Also note that our private variables are prefixed with double underscores as
 * well because of a HPHP bug.  Any subclass that uses the same variable names
 * will affect these variables as well.
