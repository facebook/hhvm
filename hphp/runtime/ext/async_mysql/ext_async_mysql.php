/**
 * An asynchronous MySQL client.
 *
 * This class allows you to asynchronously connect to a MySQL client. You
 * can directly connect to the MySQL client with the `connect()` method; in
 * addition you can use this class in conjunction with
 * `AsyncMysqlConnectionPool` pools by setting the limit of connections on
 * any given pool, and using `AsyncMysqlConnectionPool::connect()`.
 *
 * There is some duplication with this class. If possible, you should directly
 * construct connection pools via `new AsyncMysqlConnectionPool()` and then
 * call `AsyncMysqlConnectionPool::connect()` to connect to the MySQL client
 * using those pools. Here we optionally set pool limits and call `connect()`
 * on this class. `AsyncMysqlConnectionPool` provides more flexibility with
 * other available options, etc.
 *
 * In fact, there is discussion about deprecating `AsyncMysqlClient` all
 * together to avoid having this choice. But, for now, you can use this class
 * for asynchronous connection(s) to a MySQL database.
