Using Thrift with Hack
=====================

The Hack library for Thrift requires HHVM, and an autoloader (or manually
constructed require_once calls). To use Thrift in your Hack or PHP project,
just copy all of thrift.lib/hack/src into your codebase.

When you generate a Thrift package using the compiler, it makes no assumptions
about where your generated code will live. When using Thrift, make sure you
have an autoloader set up or that you require_once all necessary files.

Dependencies
============

HHVM

  At the time of writing HHVM provides the only implementation of the Hack
  language.
