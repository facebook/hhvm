         $y = 100;
         return $x + $y + $z;

     * $y as a use of the formal parameter $y, since it was not mentioned
     * in the use clause.
     *
     * Now consider a corner case:

     function test2() {
       $x = 20;
       $f = function ($x) use ($x) {
         return $x;
       };

     * Which $x is returned by the nested function? We have both a formal
     * and a closed-over local to choose from. In this case the
     * formal wins.
     *
     * So, what's the deal here? How do we want to structure this?
     *
     * Consider test1.  The local map at the point where we are
     * about to evaluate the nested function is:
     *
     * scopechains:
     [
       [
         [ $x -> 1; $y -> $2; $f -> 3 ]
       ]
     ]
     *
     * We will push a new scopechain so that $y comes out of scope, then
     * push *two* scopes, one for the using, and one for the formals:
     *
     * scopechains:
     [
       [
         [ $z -> 4 ]; [ $x -> 1 ]
       ];
       [
         [ $x -> 1; $y -> $2; $f -> 3 ]
       ]
     ]
     *
     * Now a lookup of $z will go to the head of the current scope chain
     * stack. A lookup of $x will go the tail. And a lookup of $y will
     * fail, because the tail of the scope chain stack is not searched.
     * When $y is encountered it will produce:
     * scopechains:
     [
       [
         [ $y -> 5; $z -> 4 ]; [ $x -> 1 ]
       ];
       [
         [ $x -> 1; $y -> $2; $f -> 3 ]
       ]
     ]
     *
     * What about test2? We will have
     * scopechains:
     [
       [
         [ $x -> 2 ]; [ $x -> 1 ]
       ];
       [
         [ $x -> 1 ]
       ]
     ]
     *
     * So a lookup of $x in the body will produce the formal.
     *
     * All right, let's proceed.
