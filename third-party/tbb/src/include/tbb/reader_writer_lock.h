    /** waiting_nonblocking: the wait state for nonblocking lock
          instances; for writes, these transition straight to active
          states; for reads, these are unused.

        waiting: the start and spin state for all lock instances; these will
          transition to active state when appropriate.  Non-blocking write locks
          transition from this state to waiting_nonblocking immediately.

        active: the active state means that the lock instance holds
          the lock; it will transition to invalid state during node deletion

        invalid: the end state for all nodes; this is set in the
          destructor so if we encounter this state, we are looking at
          memory that has already been freed

        The state diagrams below describe the status transitions.
        Single arrows indicate that the thread that owns the node is
        responsible for the transition; double arrows indicate that
        any thread could make the transition.
